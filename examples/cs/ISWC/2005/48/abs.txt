In this paper we benchmark three popular database representations of RDF/S schemata and data: (a) a schema-aware (i.e., one table per RDF/S class or property) with explicit (ISA) or implicit (NOISA) storage of subsumption relationships, (b) a schema-oblivious (i.e., a single table with triples of the form 〈subject-predicate-object〉), using (ID) or not (URI) identifiers to represent resources and (c) a hybrid of the schema-aware and schema-oblivious representations (i.e., one table per RDF/S meta-class by distinguishing also the range type of properties). Furthermore, we benchmark two common approaches for evaluating taxonomic queries either on-the-fly (ISA, NOISA, Hybrid), or by precomputing the transitive closure of subsumption relationships (MatView, URI, ID). The main conclusion drawn from our experiments is that the evaluation of taxonomic queries is most efficient over RDF/S stores utilizing the Hybrid and MatView representations. Of the rest, schema-aware representations (ISA, NOISA) exhibit overall better performance than URI, which is superior to that of ID, which exhibits the overall worst performance.
