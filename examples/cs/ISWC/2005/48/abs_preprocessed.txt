Furthermore, we benchmark two common approaches for evaluating taxonomic queries either on-the-fly ) ( MatView, not, ID ).
Furthermore, we benchmark two common approaches for evaluating taxonomic queries either explicit, NOISA, Hybrid ) ( MatView, not, ID ).
Furthermore, we benchmark two common approaches by precomputing the transitive closure of subsumption relationships ( MatView, not, ID ).
The main conclusion drawn from we experiments.
The main conclusion is that the evaluation of taxonomic queries is most efficient over RDFS stores utilizing the Hybrid representations.
The main conclusion is that the evaluation of taxonomic queries is most efficient over RDFS stores utilizing the MatView representations.
