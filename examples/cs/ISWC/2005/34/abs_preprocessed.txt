One of the main goals of the semantic web services effort is to enable automated composition of web services.
An end-to-end view of the service composition process involves automation of composite service creation.
An end-to-end view of the service composition process involves deployment on an execution environment.
An end-to-end view of the service composition process involves development of executable workflows.
However, the main focus in literature has been on the initial part of formally representing web service capabilities and reasoning about the main focus in literature composition.
the main focus in literature composition using AI techniques.
Based upon our experience in building an end-to-end composition tool for application integration, our bring out issues.
issues that have an impact on information modeling aspects of the composition process.
In this paper, we present approaches for solving problems relating to scalability of service descriptions and data flow construction for operationalizing the composed services.
In this paper, we present approaches for solving problems relating to manageability of service descriptions and data flow construction for operationalizing the composed services.
