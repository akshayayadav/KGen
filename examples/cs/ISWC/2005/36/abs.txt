We propose a declarative update language for RDF graphs which is based on the paradigms of query and view languages RQL and RVL. Our language, called RUL, ensures that the execution of the update primitives on nodes and arcs neither violates the semantics of the RDF model nor the semantics of the given RDFS schema. In addition, RUL supports fine-grained updates at the class and property instance level, set-oriented updates with a deterministic semantics and takes benefit of the full expressive power of RQL for restricting the range of variables to nodes and arcs of RDF graphs.
