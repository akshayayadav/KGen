RDF graphs which is based on the paradigms of view languages RQL.
RDF graphs which is based on the paradigms of query languages RQL.
We propose a declarative update language for RDF graphs.
RDF graphs which is based on the paradigms of RVL.
Our language ensures that the execution of the update primitives on nodes.
Our language ensures that the execution of the violates the semantics of the RDF model.
Our language ensures that the execution of the update primitives on arcs.
Our language called RUL.
Our language ensures that the execution of the violates the semantics of the given RDFS schema.
In addition, RUL supports fine-grained updates at the class set-oriented updates with a deterministic semantics.
In addition, RUL takes benefit of the full expressive power of RQL for restricting the range of variables to arcs of RDF graphs.

In addition, RUL supports fine-grained updates at property instance level set-oriented updates with a deterministic semantics.
