This paper extends the model theory of RDF with rules, placing an emphasis on integration with OWL and decidability of entailment. We start from an abstract syntax that views a rule as a pair of rule graphs which generalize RDF graphs by also allowing rule variables in subject, predicate and object positions. We include RDFS as well as a decidable part of OWL that weakens D-entailment and OWL Full. Classes can be used as instances. Almost all examples in the DAML set of test rules are covered by our approach.
