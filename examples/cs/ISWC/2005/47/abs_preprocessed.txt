This paper extends the model theory of RDF with rules, placing an emphasis on integration with decidability of entailment.

rule graphs which generalize RDF graphs by also allowing rule variables in object positions.
rule graphs which generalize RDF graphs by also allowing rule variables in subject positions.
We start from an abstract syntax.
rule graphs which generalize RDF graphs by also allowing rule variables in predicate positions.
an abstract syntax that views a rule as a pair of rule graphs.
We include a decidable part of OWL.
OWL that weakens OWL Full.
OWL that weakens D-entailment.
We include RDFS.
Classes can be used as instances.
Almost all examples in the DAML set of test rules are covered by We approach.
