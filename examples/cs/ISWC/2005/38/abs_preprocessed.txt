Most existing ontology mapping tools.
Most are inexact.
the applications that use Inexact ontology mapping rules, if not rectified,.
Inexact ontology mapping rules, if not rectified, result in imprecision in the applications.
existing ontology mappings using a Bayesian Network.
We describe a framework to probabilistically improve existing ontology mappings.
meta-rules that captures the influence of the existing matches to match nodes.
meta-rules that captures the influence of the ontology structure to match nodes.
an Ontology Mapping ENhancer, is based on a set of meta-rules.
nodes that are neighbours to matched nodes in the two ontologies.
Omen , is based on a set of meta-rules.
a protype ontology matcher that can either map concepts across two input ontologies.
a protype ontology matcher that can either enhance existing matches between ontology concepts.
We have implemented a protype ontology matcher.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that Omen enhances existing ontology mappings in our test cases.
