A common practice in conceptual modeling is to separate the intensional from the extensional model.
Although very intuitive, this approach is inadequate for many complex domains.
many complex domains where the borderline between the two models is not clear-cut.
Therefore, the most expressive of the Semantic Web ontology languages, allows combining the extensional model by a feature we refer to as metamodeling.

Therefore, OWL-Full , allows combining the intensional by a feature we refer to as metamodeling.
Therefore, OWL-Full , allows combining the extensional model by a feature we refer to as metamodeling.
In this paper, we show that the semantics of metamodeling adopted in OWL-Full leads to undecidability of basic inference problems, due to free mixing of logical symbols.

Based on this result, we propose two alternative semantics for metamodeling: the contextual.
Based on this result, we propose two alternative semantics for metamodeling: the HiLog semantics.
we show that SHOIQ— a description logic is decidable.
OWL-DL— extended with metamodeling under either semantics.
SHOIQ— a description logic underlying OWL-DL—.
Finally, we show how the latter semantics can be used in practice to axiomatize the logical interaction between metaconcepts.
