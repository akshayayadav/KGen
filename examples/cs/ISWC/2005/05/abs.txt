In this paper, we apply automatic tools to the verification of interaction protocols of Web services described in OWL-S. Specifically, we propose a modeling procedure that preserves the control flow and the data flow of OWL-S Process Models. The result of our work provides complete modeling and verification of OWL-S Process Models.
