Web services described in OWL-S.
In this paper, we apply automatic tools to the verification of interaction protocols of Web services.
a modeling procedure that preserves the control flow Process Models.
Specifically, we propose a modeling procedure.
a modeling procedure that preserves the data flow of OWL-S Process Models.
The result of we work provides complete modeling and verification of OWL-S Process Models.
