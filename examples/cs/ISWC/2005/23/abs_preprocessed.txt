In this paper The proposed method is proposed in which sensitive data in an RDF-graph is encrypted for a set of recipients while all non-sensitive data remain publicly readable.
an RDF-compliant self-describing graph containing plaintext data.
an RDF-compliant self-describing graph containing encrypted data.
The result is an RDF-compliant self-describing graph.
an RDF-compliant self-describing graph containing encryption metadata.
For the representation of encrypted data the XML-Encryption are used.
For the representation of encryption metadata XML-Signature recommendations are used.
For the representation of encrypted data XML-Signature recommendations are used.
For the representation of encryption metadata the XML-Encryption are used.
The proposed method allows for fine-grained encryption of arbitrary subjects, predicates, objects of an RDF-graph.
The proposed method allows for fine-grained encryption of arbitrary subjects, predicates, subgraphs of an RDF-graph.
An XML vocabulary for specifying encryption policies is introduced.
