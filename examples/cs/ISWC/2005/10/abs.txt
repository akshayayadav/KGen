The semantic web presents the vision of a distributed, dynamically growing knowledge base founded on formal logic. Common users, however, seem to have problems even with the simplest Boolean expressions. As queries from web search engines show, the great majority of users simply do not use Boolean expressions. So how can we help users to query a web of logic that they do not seem to understand? We address this problem by presenting a natural language interface to semantic web querying. The interface allows formulating queries in Attempto Controlled English (ACE), a subset of natural English. Each ACE query is translated into a discourse representation structure – a variant of the language of first-order logic – that is then translated into an N3-based semantic web querying language using an ontology-based rewriting framework. As the validation shows, our approach offers great potential for bridging the gap between the logic-based semantic web and its real-world users, since it allows users to query the semantic web without having to learn an unfamiliar formal language. Furthermore, we found that users liked our approach and designed good queries resulting in a very good retrieval performance (100
