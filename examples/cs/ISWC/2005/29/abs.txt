In this paper we propose a framework for reasoning with multi-version ontology, in which a temporal logic is developed to serve as its semantic foundation. We show that the temporal logic approach can provide a solid semantic foundation which can support various requirements on multi-version ontology reasoning. We have implemented the prototype of MORE (Multi-version Ontology REasoner), which is based on the proposed framework. We have tested MORE with several realistic ontologies. In this paper, we also discuss the implementation issues and report the experiments with MORE.
