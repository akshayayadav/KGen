In this paper we propose a framework for reasoning with multi-version ontology.
multi-version ontology in which a temporal logic is developed to serve as this paper semantic foundation.
we show that the temporal logic approach can provide a solid semantic foundation.
a solid semantic foundation which can support various requirements on multi-version ontology reasoning.
MORE ) which is based on the proposed framework.
we have implemented the prototype of Multi-version Ontology REasoner ).
Multi-version Ontology REasoner ) which is based on the proposed framework.
we have implemented the prototype of MORE ).
we have tested MORE with several realistic ontologies.
In this paper, we report the experiments with MORE.
In this paper, we also discuss the implementation issues.
