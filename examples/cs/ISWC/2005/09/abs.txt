In this paper, a system, RitroveRAI, addressing the general problem of enriching a multimedia news stream with semantic metadata is presented. News metadata here are explicitly derived from transcribed sentences or implicitly expressed into a topical category automatically detected. The enrichment process is accomplished by searching the same news expressed by different agencies reachable over the Web. Metadata extraction from the alternative sources (i.e. Web pages) is similarly applied and finally integration of the sources (according to some heuristic of pertinence) is carried out. Performance evaluation of the current system prototype has been carried out on a large scale. It confirms the viability of the RitroveRAI approach for realistic (i.e. 24 hours) applications and continuous monitoring and metadata extraction from multimedia news data.
