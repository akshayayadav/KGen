Domain ontologies very rarely model verbs as relations holding between concepts.

a central connecting element between concepts.
However, the role of the verb as a central is undeniable.
Verbs specify the interaction between the participants of some action or event by expressing relations between Verbs.
In parallel, it can be argued from an ontology engineering point of view that verbs express a relation between two classes.
two classes that specify domain.
two classes that specify range.
The work is concerned with relation extraction for ontology extension along these lines.
The work described here.
