We introduce an experience in building a public semantic web server maintaining annotations about the actors of a Telecom Valley. We then focus on an example of inference used in building one type of cartography of the competences of the economic actors of the Telecom Valley. We detailed how this inference exploits the graph model of the semantic web using ontology-based metrics and conceptual clustering. We prove the characteristics of theses metrics and inferences and we give the associated interpretations.
