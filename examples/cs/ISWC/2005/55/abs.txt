We show how state-of-the-art Semantic Web technology can be used in e-Science, in particular, to automate the classification of proteins in biology. We show that the resulting classification was of comparable quality to that performed by a human expert, and how investigations using the classified data even resulted in the discovery of significant information that had previously been overlooked, leading to the identification of a possible drug-target.
