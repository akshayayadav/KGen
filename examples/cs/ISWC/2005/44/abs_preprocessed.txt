Ontologies are today a key part of every knowledge.

Unfortunately, the variety of ways that a domain can be conceptualized results in the creation of different ontologies with contradicting parts.
Unfortunately, the variety of ways that a domain can be conceptualized results in the creation of different ontologies with overlapping parts.
For this reason ontologies need to be brought into mutual agreement ( aligned ).
One important method for ontology alignment is the comparison of property names of ontologies.
One important method for ontology alignment is the comparison of class names of ontologies.
ontologies using string-distance metrics.
Today quite a lot of such metrics exist in literature.
But all of them have been initially developed for different applications and fields, resulting in poor performance.

In the current paper we present a new string metric for the comparison of names.
