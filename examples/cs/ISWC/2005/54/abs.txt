Triple20 is a ontology manipulation and visualization tool for languages built on top of the Semantic-Web RDF triple model. In this article we explain how a triple-centered design compares to the use of a separate proprietary internal data model. We show how to deal with the problems of such a low-level data model and show that it offers advantages when dealing with inconsistent or incomplete data as well as for integrating tools.
