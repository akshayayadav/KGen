design patterns that improve the techniques.
The paper presents a framework for introducing design patterns.
Some distinctions are drawn between kinds of ontology design patterns.
Some content-oriented patterns are presented how Some content-oriented patterns can be specialized.
Some content-oriented patterns are presented in order to illustrate Some content-oriented patterns utility at different degrees of abstraction.
Some content-oriented patterns are presented how Some content-oriented patterns can be composed.
The proposed framework are designed in order to function as a pipeline.
a pipeline connecting user requirements to be executed.
the initial set of patterns are designed in order to function as a pipeline.
a pipeline connecting domain modelling to be executed.
a pipeline connecting ontology-driven tasksqueries to be executed.
