As more of these workflows are built, scientists start sharing stand-alone compositions of workflow fragments.
As more of these workflows are built, scientists start reusing stand-alone compositions of workflow fragments.
As more of these workflows are built, scientists start reusing stand-alone compositions of services.

scientists repurpose an existing workflow by finding one.
one that is close enough to be the basis of a new workflow for a different purpose.
scientists repurpose workflow fragment by making small changes to a new workflow for a different purpose.

Such a “ workflow by example ” approach complements the popular view in the Semantic Web Services literature that on-line processes are constructed automatically from scratch.
Such a “ workflow by example ” approach could help bootstrap the Web of Science.
Based on a comparison of e-Science middleware projects, this paper identifies seven bottlenecks to scalable reuse and repurposing.
We include some thoughts on the applicability of using workflow fragment discovery.
We include some thoughts on the applicability of using OWL for two bottlenecks.
We include some thoughts on the applicability of using the ranking of fragments.
