Semantic query optimization has been extensively studied for object.
Semantic query optimization has been proved to be e.g., data integration, graphical query generators, caching ).
Semantic query optimization has been extensively studied for deductive.
Semantic query optimization has been extensively studied for relational.
Semantic query optimization has been extensively studied for XML databases.
Semantic query optimization has been proved to be quite useful in various applications ).
However, less attention to Semantic query optimization has been devoted in the context of the Semantic Web.
In this paper, we present complete algorithms for the containment and minimization of RDFS query patterns.
In this paper, we present sound algorithms for the containment and minimization of RDFS query patterns.
More precisely, we consider two widely used RDFS query fragments but also, at the schema level.
RDFS query fragments supporting pattern matching at the data.
we employ well-established techniques.
well-established techniques proposed in the relational context, in particular.
To this end.
well-established techniques proposed in the relational context, in the Backchase algorithms.
well-established techniques proposed in the relational context, in the Chase algorithms.
we advocate a logic framework for capturing the RDFS data model.
