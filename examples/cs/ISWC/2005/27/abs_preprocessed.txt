We introduce a framework for preferential reasoning with agents on the Semantic Web.
a framework based on logic programming.
Initially, we encode the knowledge of an agent as a logic program.
a logic program equipped with call literals.
Such call literals enable an agent to pose yesno queries to arbitrary knowledge sources on the Semantic Web, without conditions on.
Such call literals enable an agent to pose yesno queries to arbitrary knowledge sources on the Semantic Web, without the representation language of those sources.
the extended answer set semantics.
semantics which can provide different strategies for solving those conflicts.
As those conflicts may arise from reasoning with different knowledge sources, we use the extended answer.
Allowing, in addition, for an agent to express its preference for the satisfaction of certain rules over others, we can then induce a preference order on those strategies.
However, since it is natural for an agent to believe it own knowledge ( encoded in the program ) it can alternatively express preferences on call literals.
However, since it consider some sources more reliable than others it can alternatively express preferences on call literals.
Finally, we show how an agent can learn preferences on call literals if an agent is part of a web of trusted agents.
