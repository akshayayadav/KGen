We introduce a framework, based on logic programming, for preferential reasoning with agents on the Semantic Web. Initially, we encode the knowledge of an agent as a logic program equipped with call literals. Such call literals enable the agent to pose yes/no queries to arbitrary knowledge sources on the Semantic Web, without conditions on, e.g., the representation language of those sources. As conflicts may arise from reasoning with different knowledge sources, we use the extended answer set semantics, which can provide different strategies for solving those conflicts. Allowing, in addition, for an agent to express its preference for the satisfaction of certain rules over others, we can then induce a preference order on those strategies. However, since it is natural for an agent to believe its own knowledge (encoded in the program) but consider some sources more reliable than others, it can alternatively express preferences on call literals. Finally, we show how an agent can learn preferences on call literals if it is part of a web of trusted agents.
