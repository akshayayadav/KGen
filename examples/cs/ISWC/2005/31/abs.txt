Discovery of semantic associations in Semantic Web ontologies is an important task in various analytical activities. Several query languages and storage systems have been designed and implemented for storage and retrieval of information in RDF ontologies. However, they are inadequate for semantic association discovery. In this paper we present the design and implementation of BRAHMS, an efficient RDF storage system, specifically designed to support fast semantic association discovery in large RDF bases. We present memory usage and timing results of several tests performed with BRAHMS and compare them to similar tests performed using Jena, Sesame, and Redland, three of the well-known RDF storage systems. Our results show that BRAHMS handles basic association discovery well, while the RDF query languages and even the low-level APIs in the other three tested systems are not suitable for the implementation of semantic association discovery algorithms.
