E-Science experiments typically involve many distributed services.
many distributed services maintained by different organisations.
After an experiment has been executed, it is useful for a scientist to verify that the execution is compatible with some existing experimental criteria.
After an experiment has been executed, it is useful for a scientist to verify that the execution was performed correctly.
After an experiment has been executed, it is useful for a scientist to verify that the execution is compatible with standards.
Scientists may also want to verify experiments.
Scientists may also want to review experiments.
experiments performed by Scientists colleagues.
There are no exsiting frameworks for validating such experiments in todayâ€™s e-Science systems.
Users therefore have to adopt other ad hoc methods.
error checking performed by the services.
Users therefore have to rely on error checking.
This paper introduces a platform-independent framework for validating workflow executions.
This paper relies on reasoning over the documented provenance of experiment results.
services advertised in a registry.
This paper relies on reasoning over semantic descriptions of services.
This validation process ensures experiments are performed correctly.
This validation process ensures thus results generated are meaningful.
The framework is tested in a bioinformatics application.
a bioinformatics application that performs protein compressibility analysis.
