We propose a new technique for approximate ABox reasoning with OWL DL ontologies.
Essentially, We obtain substantially improved reasoning performance by disregarding non-Horn features of OWL DL.
We approach comes as a side-product of recent research rests on the idea of performing standard resolution over disjunctive rules by treating disjunctive rules as if disjunctive rules were non-disjunctive ones.
We approach comes as a side-product of recent research results concerning a new transformation of OWL DL ontologies into negation-free disjunctive datalog 1, 2, 3, 4.
an implementation called Screech.
We analyse We reasoning approach by means of non-monotonic reasoning techniques.
We present an implementation.
