WS-Policy leading the way.
Recently, there have been a number of proposals for languages for expressing web service constraints and capabilities, with WS-Policy.
WSPL leading the way.
Recently, there have been a number of proposals for languages for expressing web service constraints and capabilities, with WSPL.
The proposed languages, although relatively inexpressive, suffer from a lack of formal semantics.
In this paper, we describe how standard the Web Ontology Language reasoners can be used to check policy conformance.
In this paper, we provide a mapping of WS-Policy to the description logic fragment species of the Web Ontology Language.
In this paper, we describe how standard the Web Ontology Language reasoners can be used to perform an array of policy analysis tasks.
the Web Ontology Language is much more expressive than WS-Policy.
the Web Ontology Language thus provides a framework for exploring richer policy languages.
