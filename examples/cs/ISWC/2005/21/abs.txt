Ontology tools performance and scalability are critical to both the growth of the Semantic Web and the establishment of these tools in the industry. In this paper, we present briefly the benchmarking methodology used to improve the performance and the scalability of ontology development tools. We focus on the definition of the infrastructure for evaluating the performance of these toolsâ€™ ontology management APIs in terms of its execution efficiency. We also present the results of applying the methodology for evaluating the API of the WebODE ontology engineering workbench.
