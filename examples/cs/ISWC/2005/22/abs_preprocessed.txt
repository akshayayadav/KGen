all these algorithms have been quite successfully employed in a variety of scenarios from filtering applications to recommendations of books at Amazon.com.
all these algorithms have been quite successfully employed in a variety of scenarios from filtering applications to recommendations of movies at Amazon.com.
However, all these algorithms focus on single item recommendations.
However, all these algorithms do not consider any more complex recommendation structures.
semantically rich complex recommendation structures represented as RDF graphs.
This paper explores how semantically rich complex recommendation structures can be shared in a distributed social network.
This paper explores how semantically rich complex recommendation structures can be exchanged in a distributed social network.
After presenting a motivating scenario we define several annotation ontologies we use in order to show how our ranking algorithm can exploit this information.
After presenting a motivating scenario we define several annotation ontologies we use in order to describe context information on the userâ€™s desktop.
We discuss how members of these interest groups share semantically rich recommendations in such a network.
We discuss how these interest groups are specified using extended FOAF vocabulary.
We discuss how social distributed networks are specified using extended FOAF vocabulary.
semantically rich recommendations in such a network shared context described in annotation ontologies.
semantically rich recommendations in such a network shared ranking information described in annotation ontologies.
We propose an algorithm to show how rankings are influenced by the reputation of the members of the social network with whom the context is exchanged.
We propose an algorithm to show how rankings are influenced by the context.
We propose an algorithm to compute these rankings.
these rankings which exploits available context information.
the context received from other users.
