As long as there is not a sufficient base of RDF-annotated pages, the benefits of participating in the Semantic Web are barely visible. This is true in particular for content providers like individuals or small institutions. These potential participants can’t afford the additional work necessary for the Semantic Web, yet they’re needed for the Semantic Web to reach the critical mass that will make it a success. This paper discusses problems that may prevent small content providers from participating in the Semantic Web, as well as a possible way to lower the barrier for entry using tools like our own Information Layer system.
