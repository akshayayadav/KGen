Grids are an emerging computational infrastructure.
an emerging computational infrastructure that coordinated problem.
an emerging computational infrastructure that enables resource sharing.
problem solving across dynamic, distributed collaborations.
distributed collaborations that have come to be known as virtual organizations.
Unlike the web the Grid provides a range of fundamental mechanisms for sharing diverse types of resource, such as scientific instruments.
Unlike the web the Grid provides a range of fundamental mechanisms for sharing diverse types of resource, such as storage.
Unlike the web the Grid provides a range of fundamental mechanisms for sharing diverse types of resource, such as computers.
the web which primarily focuses on the sharing of information.
Unlike the web the Grid provides a range of fundamental mechanisms for sharing diverse types of resource, such as data.
Unlike the web the Grid provides a range of fundamental mechanisms for sharing diverse types of resource, such as software.
In this talk, I will introduce the Grid concept.
In this talk, I illustrate the Grid concept with application examples from a range of scientific disciplines.
technology that is being developed for the Semantic Web.
some of these potential areas of the Semantic Web technologies identifying those that I think offer the most potential.
It is likely that technology will have important roles to play in Grid Services; I will explore some of these potential areas of the Semantic Web technologies.
