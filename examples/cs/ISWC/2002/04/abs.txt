The paper reviews the notions of expressiveness of description logics from (N. Kurtonina and M. de Rijke. Expressiveness of concept expressions in first-order description logics. Artificial Intelligence, 107:303–333, 1999) and exemplifies their use in the development in Semantic Web languages. The notion of bisimulation—which characterizes the description logic

— provides a direct link to what’s in the field of sociology called social network analysis. The perspective on data in this field—data are represented as labeled graphs—fits exactly the modeling intuitions of web languages like oil and daml+oil. This is exemplified in the study of trophic networks. A further connection is established between web languages and hybrid logic, and an extension of oil with a limited form of self reference is proposed.
