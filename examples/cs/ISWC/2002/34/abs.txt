This paper suggests four steps towards the realization of a semantic web. Promotion of the idea should be based on practical application. There is need for the immediate development of practical demonstration applications. Simplicity and tolerance of error should be prime targets of research and development. An Open Source project to develop and populate a framework of tools and applications should be started.
