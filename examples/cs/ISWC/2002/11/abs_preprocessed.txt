Describing web resources using formal knowledge ) is the essence of the next evolution step of the Semantic Web, termed the Semantic Web.
Describing web resources using i.e., creating metadata according to a formal representation of a domain of discourse ) is the essence of the next evolution step of the Semantic Web, termed the Semantic Web.
the Semantic Web RDFS ) enables the creation and exchange of resource metadata as normal web data.
Resource Description FrameworkSchema Language ) enables the creation and exchange of resource metadata as normal web data.
In the Semantic Web, we investigate the use of RDFS schemas as a means of knowledge representation and exchange in diverse application domains.
a statistical analysis performed with the aid of VRP, the Validating RDF Parser.
In order to reason about the quality of existing RDF schemas, a benchmark serves as the basis of a statistical analysis.
The statistical data extracted lead to corollaries about the size.
The statistical data extracted lead to corollaries about the morphology of RDFS schemas.
Furthermore, the study of the collected schemas draws useful conclusions about the actual use of RDF modeling constructs.
Furthermore, the study of the collected schemas draws useful conclusions about frequent misuses of RDFS syntax andor semantics.
