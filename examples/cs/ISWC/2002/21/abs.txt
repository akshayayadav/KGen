There are two major ongoing efforts to advance the World Wide Web. On one side there is the Semantic Web research, on the other side is the Web Service research. Both activities aim to make content on the web accessible and usable not only for humans but also for machines in order to create a foundation for intelligent automated services and business processes. These two efforts are highly complementary, and there is work in progress towards a unification of them. This paper contributes to this process of unification by presenting a method of connecting Web Services descriptions with Semantic Web ontologies.
