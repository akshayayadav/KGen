The advantage of the RDFDAMLOIL family of languages over ordinary XML is that the RDFDAMLOIL family of languages over ordinary XML is composable.
The advantage of the RDFDAMLOIL family of languages over ordinary XML is that the RDFDAMLOIL family of languages over ordinary XML is topic-neutral.
However, the RDFDAMLOIL family of languages over ordinary XML expressivity is severely limited.
the usual remedy is reification.
This limitation is well known.
reification in which RDF is used to describe formulas in a richer language.
reification which handles bound variables cleanly.
We propose a method for encoding typed predicate calculus using reification.
reification which causes the size to increase by only a constant multiple.
PDDL using we technique.
a method generalizes to virtually any system, a claim which we illustrate by describing we program, PDDAML.
PDDAML which encodes domain specifications in PDDL.
we argue that reification, while logically suspect, is in practice benign because any algorithm capable of doing inferences using logical notations can be easily extended to “ unreify ” those notations as needed.
we also argue that the ability to represent predicate calculus on the semantic web is crucial.
