advanced business document integration technologies performing intelligent document transformation.
the Web that require development of advanced business document integration technologies.
The Semantic Web would enable new ways of doing business on the Web.
The documents use different vocabularies.
different vocabularies that consist of large hierarchies of terms.
Accordingly, transformation becomes an important task in the whole business document transformation process.
Accordingly, vocabulary mapping becomes an important task in the whole business document transformation process.
an important task in the whole business document transformation process includes map representation.
an important task in the whole business document transformation process includes map discovery.
map execution that must be seamlessly integrated into the document integration process.
an important task in the whole business document transformation process includes several subtasks.
an important task in the whole business document transformation process includes map execution.
each using one of the vocabularies.
In this paper we discuss the process of discovering the discovered maps, each.
We take the vocabularies of product classification codes as a playground.
We take the vocabularies of product classification propose a reusable map discovery technique based on Bayesian text classification approach.
We show how the discovered maps can be integrated into the document integration process.
