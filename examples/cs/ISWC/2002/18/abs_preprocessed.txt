a Query Exchange Language which can be used as lingua franca to retrieve information from RDF repositories.
Part of EDUTELLA is a Query Exchange Language.
This work shows why we also need standardization of distributed modification capabilities.
we use replication services as guideline for we approach towards a Modification Exchange Language for distributed RDF repositories.
we use annotation services as guideline for we approach towards a Modification Exchange Language for distributed RDF repositories.
we describe use case scenarios for annotation services.
