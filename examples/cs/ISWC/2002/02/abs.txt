The Resource Description Framework (RDF) describes graphs of statements about resources. RDF is a fundamental lower layer of the semantic web. This paper explores the equality of two RDF graphs in light of the graph isomorphism literature. We consider anonymous resources as unlabelled vertices in a graph, and show that the standard graph isomorphism algorithms, developed in the 1970â€™s, can be used effectively for comparing RDF graphs. The techniques presented are useful for testing RDF software.
