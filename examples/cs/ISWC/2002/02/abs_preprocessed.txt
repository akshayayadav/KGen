RDF describes graphs of statements about resources.
RDF is a fundamental lower layer of the semantic web.
This paper explores the equality of two RDF graphs in light of the graph isomorphism literature.
We show that the standard graph isomorphism algorithms can be used effectively for comparing RDF graphs.
We consider anonymous resources as unlabelled vertices in a graph.
the standard graph isomorphism algorithms developed in the 1970â€™s.
The techniques presented.
The techniques are useful for testing RDF software.
