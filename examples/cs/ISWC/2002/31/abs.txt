This paper describes a mini-experiment in using a tool for semantic annotation to index photographs of Windsor chairs, a type of antique furniture. The annotation tool makes use of an ontology based on art standards. We report on the experiences of subjects using the tool. The results suggest that a certain level of domain expertise is needed for semantic annotations, but also that an annotation tool has a clear added value for indexers.
