Current service retrieval technology is, however, notoriously prone to low precision.
This paper describes a novel service retrieval approached based on the sophisticated use of process ontologies.
Our preliminary evaluations suggest that this approach offers qualitatively higher retrieval precision than existing approaches without sacrificing recall.
