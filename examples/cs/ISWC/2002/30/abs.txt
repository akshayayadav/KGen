This paper describes some initial work on a NetAPI for accessing and updating RDF data over the web. The NetAPI includes actions for conditional extraction or update of RDF data, actions for model upload and download and also the ability to enquire about the capabilities of a hosting server. An initial experimental system is described which partially implements these ideas within the Jena toolkit.
