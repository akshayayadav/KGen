Entailment, as defined by RDF’s model-theoretical semantics, is a basic requirement for processing RDF, and represents the kind of “semantic interoperability” that RDF-based systems have been anticipated to have to realize the vision of the “Semantic Web”. In this paper we give some results in our investigation of a practical implementation of the entailment rules, based on the graph-walking query mechanism of the Wilbur RDF toolkit.
