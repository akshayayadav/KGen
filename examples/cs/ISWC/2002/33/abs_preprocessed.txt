It is useful to express the location of a node in a semantic graph in terms of a sequence of knowledge-bearing arcs.
knowledge-bearing arcs that lead to the node from a node.
a node that is used as a point of reference.
the arcs on which such “ graph-based ” depend.
graph-based addressing expressions.
If the arcs disappear, the expressions become invalid.
