Statistical data in the form of RDF Data Cubes is becoming increasingly valuable as it influences decisions in areas such as health care, policy and finance. While a growing amount is becoming freely available through the open data movement, this data is opaque to laypersons. Semantic Question Answering (SQA) technologies provide intuitive access via free-form natural language queries but general SQA systems cannot process RDF Data Cubes. On the intersection between RDF Data Cubes and SQA, we create a new subfield of SQA, called RDCQA. We create an RDQCA benchmark as task 3 of the QALD-6 evaluation challenge, to stimulate further research and enable quantitative comparison between RDCQA systems. We design and evaluate the domain independent CubeQA algorithm, which is the first RDCQA system and achieves a global F_1 score of 0.43 on the QALD6T3-test benchmark, showing that RDCQA is feasible.
