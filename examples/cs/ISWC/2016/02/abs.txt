We propose an OBDA approach for accessing geospatial data stored in relational databases, using the OGC standard GeoSPARQL and R2RML or OBDA mappings. We introduce extensions to an existing SPARQL-to-SQL translation method to support GeoSPARQL features. We describe the implementation of our approach in the system ontop-spatial, an extension of the OBDA system Ontop for creating virtual geospatial RDF graphs on top of geospatial relational databases. We present an experimental evaluation of our system using and extending a state-of-the-art benchmark. To measure the performance of our system, we compare it to a state-of-the-art geospatial RDF store and confirm its efficiency.
