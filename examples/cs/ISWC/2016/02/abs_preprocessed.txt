We propose an OBDA approach for accessing geospatial data using the OGC standard GeoSPARQL.
We propose an OBDA approach for accessing geospatial data using OBDA mappings.
We propose an OBDA approach for accessing geospatial data using R2RML mappings.
geospatial data stored in relational databases.
We introduce extensions to an existing SPARQL-to-SQL translation method to support GeoSPARQL features.
We describe the implementation of We approach in the system ontop-spatial, an extension of the OBDA system Ontop for creating virtual geospatial RDF graphs on top of geospatial relational databases.
We present an experimental evaluation of We system extending a state-of-the-art benchmark.
We present an experimental evaluation of We system using a state-of-the-art benchmark.
To measure the performance of our system, We compare our system to a state-of-the-art geospatial RDF store.
To measure the performance of our system, We confirm our system efficiency.
