User validation is one of the challenges facing the ontology alignment community, as there are limits to the quality of automated alignment algorithms. In this paper we present a broad study on user validation of ontology alignments that encompasses three distinct but interrelated aspects: the profile of the user, the services of the alignment system, and its user interface. We discuss key issues pertaining to the alignment validation process under each of these aspects, and provide an overview of how current systems address them. Finally, we use experiments from the Interactive Matching track of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) 2015 to assess the impact of errors in alignment validation, and how systems cope with them as function of their services.
