Evaluating joins over RDF data stored in a shared-nothing server cluster is key to processing truly large RDF datasets.
the data exchange operator that is inserted into the query plan statically ( i.e., at query compile time ) to shuffle data between servers.
To the best of our knowledge, the existing approaches use a variant of the data exchange operator.
distributed query answering that consists of two main components.
our argue that such approaches often miss opportunities for local computation.
we present a novel solution to distributed query.
First, we present a query.
a query answering algorithm based on dynamic data exchange.
dynamic data exchange which exploits data locality to maximise the amount of computation on a single server.
graph partitioning whose aim is to increase data locality.
RDF data based on graph partitioning.
Second, we present a partitioning algorithm for RDF data.
our performance evaluation suggests that our techniques outperform the state of the art by up to an order of magnitude in terms of query evaluation times.
our performance evaluation suggests that our techniques outperform the state of the art by up to an order of magnitude in terms of network communication.
our have implemented our approach in the RDFox system.
our performance evaluation suggests that our techniques outperform the state of the art by up to an order of magnitude in terms of memory use.
