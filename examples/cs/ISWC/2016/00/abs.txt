On-the-fly generation of integrated representations of Linked Data (LD) search results is challenging because it requires successfully automating a number of complex subtasks, such as structure inference and matching of both instances and concepts, each of which gives rise to uncertain outcomes. Such uncertainty is unavoidable given the semantically heterogeneous nature of web sources, including LD ones. This paper approaches the problem of structuring LD search results as an evidence-based one. In particular, the paper shows how one formalism (viz., probabilistic soft logic (PSL)) can be exploited to assimilate different sources of evidence in a principled way and to beneficial effect for users. The paper considers syntactic evidence derived from matching algorithms, semantic evidence derived from LD vocabularies, and user evidence, in the form of feedback. The main contributions are: sets of PSL rules that model the uniform assimilation of diverse kinds of evidence, an empirical evaluation of how the resulting PSL programs perform in terms of their ability to infer structure for integrating LD search results, and, finally, a concrete example of how populating such inferred structures for presentation to the end user is beneficial, besides enabling the collection of feedback whose assimilation further improves search result presentation.
