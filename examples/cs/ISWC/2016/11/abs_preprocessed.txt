According to its model-theoretic semantics model-theoretic semantics, Semantic Web IRIs are predicate letters.
letters whose names are chosen arbitrarily.
According to its model-theoretic semantics model-theoretic semantics, Semantic Web IRIs are carry no formal meaning.
According to its model-theoretic semantics model-theoretic semantics, Semantic Web IRIs are individual constants.
At the same time it is a well-known aspect of Semantic Web pragmatics that IRIs are often constructed mnemonically, in order to be meaningful to a human interpreter.
a concept that has been discussed.
The latter has traditionally been termed ‘ social meaning ’.
The latter has traditionally been termed a concept.
a concept that has been not yet quantitatively studied by the Semantic Web community.
In this paper we use methods from statistical model learning to quantify the meaning in Semantic Web names.
the meaning that is ( at least ) encoded.
In this paper we use measures of mutual information content.
we evaluate the approach over hundreds of thousands of datasets in order to illustrate the approach efficacy.
we implement the approach.
we experiments confirm that many Semantic Web names are indeed meaningful and, more interestingly, we provide a quantitative lower bound on how much meaning is encoded in names on a per-dataset basis.
To we knowledge, this is the first paper about the interaction between formal meaning.
To we knowledge, this is the first paper.
the first paper that uses statistical model learning as a method to quantify meaning in the Semantic Web context.
To we knowledge, this is the first paper about the interaction between social meaning.
These insights are useful for the design of a new generation of Semantic Web tools.
Semantic Web tools that take such social meaning into account.
