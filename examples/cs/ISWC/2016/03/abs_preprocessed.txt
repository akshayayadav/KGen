In several subject domains, classes classes may be subject to categorization, resulting in classes of classes ).
In several subject domains, classes classes may be subject to categorization, resulting in classes of or “ metaclasses ” ).
When representing these domains, one needs to capture not only these domains relations.
When representing these domains, one needs to capture not only entities of different classification levels.
the constraints that apply to entities of different classification levels.
the constraints that apply to entities of these domains relations.
We observe that this is challenging in current Semantic Web languages, as there is little support to guide the modeler in producing correct multi-level ontologies, especially because of the nuances in the constraints.
a vocabulary that can be used as a basis for multi-level ontologies in OWL along with a number of integrity constraints to prevent the construction of inconsistent models.
In order to address these representation challenges, we propose a vocabulary.
In this process we employ an axiomatic theory.
an axiomatic theory called MLT ).
