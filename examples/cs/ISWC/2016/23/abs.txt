Resolving the semantic heterogeneity in the semantic web requires finding correspondences between ontologies describing resources. In particular, with the explosive growth of data sets in the Linked Open Data, linking multiple vocabularies and ontologies simultaneously, known as holistic matching problem, becomes necessary. Currently, most state-of-the-art matching approaches are limited to pairwise matching. In this paper, we propose a holistic ontology matching approach that is modeled through a linear program extending the maximum-weighted graph matching problem with linear constraints (cardinality, structural, and coherence constraints). Our approach guarantees the optimal solution with mostly coherent alignments. To evaluate our proposal, we discuss the results of experiments performed on the Conference track of the OAEI 2015, under both holistic and pairwise matching settings.
