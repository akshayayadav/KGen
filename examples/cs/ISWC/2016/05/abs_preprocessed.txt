Query containment is one of the building block of query optimization techniques.
In the relational world, query containment is a well-studied problem.
queries that capture navigation in the graph.
At the same time it is well-understood that relational queries are not enough to cope with graph-structured data.
graph-structured data where one is interested in expressing queries.
navigational queries called Extended Property Paths.
This paper contributes a study on the problem of query containment for an expressive class of navigational queries.
Extended Property Paths are more expressive than previous navigational extension of SPARQL ) as they allow to express path negation among others.
Extended Property Paths are e.g., nested regular expressions ) as they allow to express path conjunction among others.

We attack the problem of Extended Property Paths containment.
We provide complexity bounds.
