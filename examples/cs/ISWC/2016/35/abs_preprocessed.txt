Another trend in the area of information retrieval is to take temporal aspects of a given query into account.
account when assessing the relevance of documents.
However, while this has become an established functionality in document search engines, the significance of time has not yet been recognized for entity recommendation.
In this paper, we address this gap by introducing the task of time-aware entity recommendation.
we propose the first probabilistic model.
the first probabilistic model that takes time-awareness into consideration for entity recommendation by leveraging heterogeneous knowledge of entities.
entities extracted from different data sources publicly available on the Web.
we extensively evaluate the proposed approach.
we extensively evaluate we experimental results show considerable improvements compared to time-agnostic entity recommendation approaches.
