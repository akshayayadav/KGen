Entity resolution is the task of identifying all mentions that represent the same real-world entity within a knowledge base.
Entity resolution is the task of identifying all mentions that represent the same real-world entity across multiple knowledge bases.
RDF graphs containing multiple types of nodes.
We address the problem of performing entity resolution on RDF graphs using the links between instances of different types to improve the accuracy.
For example, in a graph of products the goal is to resolve all the products.
For example, in a graph of manufacturers the goal is to resolve all the products.
For example, in a graph of manufacturers the goal is to resolve all the manufacturers.
For example, in a graph of products the goal is to resolve all the manufacturers.
We formulate this problem as a multi-type graph summarization problem.
super nodes that summarize the inter-cluster links in the original graph.
a multi-type graph summarization problem which involves clustering the nodes in each type.
each type that refer to the same entity into one super node.
each type that refer to the same entity creating weighted links among super nodes.
Experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms several state-of-the-art generic entity resolution approaches, especially in data sets with one-to-many, many-to-many relations.
