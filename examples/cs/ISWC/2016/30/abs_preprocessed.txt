To realise a semantic Web of Things, the challenge of achieving efficient Resource Description Format storage on Internet of Things devices with limited resources has to be addressed.
To realise a semantic Web of Things, the challenge of achieving efficient SPARQL query performance on Internet of Things devices with limited resources has to be addressed.
State-of-the-art SPARQL-to-SQL engines have been shown to outperform Resource Description Format stores on some benchmarks.
time-series Things data structures that employs metadata abstraction by reusing existing SPARQL engines to produce Linked Data ‘ just-in-time ’.
time-series Things data structures that employs efficient translation by reusing existing SPARQL engines to produce Linked Data ‘ just-in-time ’.
In this paper, we describe an optimisation to the SPARQL-to-SQL approach, based on a study of time-series Things data structures.
We evaluate We approach against streaming SPARQL engines in the context of Things data.

We evaluate We approach against streaming SPARQL engines in the context of scenarios.
We show that storage efficiency can be improved from 2 times to 3 orders of magnitude.
We show that with succinct row storage can be improved from 2 times to 3 orders of magnitude.
We show that query performance can be improved from 2 times to 3 orders of magnitude.
