Combinatorial creativity combines existing concepts in a novel way in order to produce new concepts. For example, we can imagine jewelry that measures blood pressure. For this, we would combine the concept of jewelry with the capabilities of medical devices. In this paper, we concentrate on creating new concepts in the description logic EL. We propose a novel language to this effect, and study its properties and complexity. We show that our language can be used to model existing inventions and (to a limited degree) to generate new concepts.
