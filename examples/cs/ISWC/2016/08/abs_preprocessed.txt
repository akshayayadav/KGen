Annotations are useful to semantically enrich other datasets with concepts of standardized vocabularies and ontologies.
Annotations are useful to semantically enrich documents.
many documents are not annotated at all.
manual annotation is a difficult process.
In the medical domain.
a difficult process making automatic annotation methods highly desirable to support human annotators.
We propose a reuse-based annotation approach.
a reuse-based annotation approach that utilizes previous annotations to annotate similar medical documents.
The approach clusters items in documents such as medical forms uses similar medical documents to determine candidate annotations for new items.
The approach clusters items in documents such as medical forms according to previous ontology-based annotations.
a new context-based strategy that considers the co-occurrence relatedness of annotating concepts.
a new context-based strategy that considers the semantic relatedness of annotating concepts.
The final annotations are selected according to a new context-based strategy.
The evaluation based on previous UMLS annotations of medical forms shows that the new approaches outperform a baseline approach for finding UMLS concepts in medical documents.
The evaluation based on previous UMLS annotations of medical forms shows that the new approaches outperform the use of the MetaMap tool for finding UMLS concepts in medical documents.
