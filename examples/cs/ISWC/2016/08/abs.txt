Annotations are useful to semantically enrich documents and other datasets with concepts of standardized vocabularies and ontologies. In the medical domain, many documents are not annotated at all and manual annotation is a difficult process making automatic annotation methods highly desirable to support human annotators. We propose a reuse-based annotation approach that utilizes previous annotations to annotate similar medical documents. The approach clusters items in documents such as medical forms according to previous ontology-based annotations and uses these clusters to determine candidate annotations for new items. The final annotations are selected according to a new context-based strategy that considers the co-occurrence and semantic relatedness of annotating concepts. The evaluation based on previous UMLS annotations of medical forms shows that the new approaches outperform a baseline approach as well as the use of the MetaMap tool for finding UMLS concepts in medical documents.
