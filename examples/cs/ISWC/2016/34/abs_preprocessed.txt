a measure supporting the detection of strong relationships between Linked Data entities.
The goal of this work is to learn a measure.
Such relationships can be obtained through a blind graph search process.
Such relationships can be represented as paths of entities.
Such relationships can be represented as paths of properties.
a blind graph search process traversing Linked Data.
a cost-function that is able to detect the strongest relationship between two given entities.
The challenge here is therefore the design of a cost-function by objectively assessing the value of a given path.
To achieve this, we use a Genetic Programming approach in a supervised learning method to generate path evaluation functions that compare well with human evaluations.
we show how such a cost-function can be generated only using basic topological features of the nodes of the paths as the paths are being traversed ( i.e. without knowledge of the whole graph ).
the properties that connect nodes in the graph.
we show how such a cost-function can be generated only using basic topological features of the nodes of the paths how it can be improved through introducing a very small amount of knowledge about the vocabularies of the properties.
