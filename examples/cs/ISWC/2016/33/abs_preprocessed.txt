The assessment of risk in medicine depends on scientific knowledge.
The assessment of risk in medicine is a crucial task.
scientific knowledge derived by systematic clinical studies on factors.
factors affecting health.
scientific knowledge derived by systematic clinical studies on particular knowledge about the current status of a particular patient.
Existing non-semantic risk prediction tools are typically based on hardcoded scientific knowledge, and only cover a very limited range of patient states.
This makes patient states rapidly out of date.
This limited in application, particularly for patients with multiple co-occurring conditions.
patients based on self-gathered biometric data.
In this work we propose an integration of Semantic Web.
In this work we Quantified Self technologies to create The implemented framework for calculating clinical risk predictions for patients.
The implemented framework relies on generic, reusable ontologies for representing clinical risk.
data represented according to generic, reusable ontologies for representing sensor readings.
The implemented framework relies on generic, reusable ontologies for representing sensor readings.
data represented according to generic, reusable ontologies for representing clinical risk.
The implemented framework relies on reasoning to support the integration of data.
The implemented framework shows a wide range of advantages over existing risk calculation.
