Semantic labeling is the process of mapping attributes in data sources to classes in an ontology.
Semantic labeling is a necessary step in heterogeneous data integration.
Variations in data formats, attribute names make this a very challenging task.
Variations in data formats, attribute even ranges of values of data make this a very challenging task.
automatic semantic labeling that uses machine learning techniques.
In this paper, we present a novel domain-independent approach to automatic semantic labeling.
machine learning to learn a model.
a model that extracts features related to the data of a domain.
Previous approaches use machine.
a domain which requires the model to be re-trained for every new domain.
Our solution uses similarity metrics as features to compare against labeled domain data.
Our solution learns a matching function to infer the correct semantic labels for data.
the learned the data the data.
Since Our approach depends on the the data needs to be trained once to work effectively across multiple domains.
the learned similarity metrics.
Since Our approach depends on the the data is domain-independent.
other approaches even when the learned models are trained on domains other than the test domain.
In Our evaluation, Our achieves higher accuracy than other approaches.
