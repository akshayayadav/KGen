numerical attributes expressing the confidence of each correspondence.
Alignments between ontologies usually come with numerical attributes.
Semantics must generalise the semantics of alignments without confidence.
Semantics supporting such confidences.
There exists a semantics.
a semantics which satisfies this.
a semantics which introduces a discontinuity between non-weighted interpretations.
a semantics which introduces a discontinuity between weighted interpretations.
Moreover, this does not provide a calculus for reasoning with weighted ontology alignments.
This paper introduces a calculus for such alignments.
This paper is given by an infinite relation-type algebra, the elements of which are weighted taxonomic relations.
In addition, This paper approximates the non-weighted case in a continuous manner.
