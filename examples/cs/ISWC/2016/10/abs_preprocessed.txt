the description logic underlying the owl 2 ql standard.
In this paper we study instance-level update in the description logic.
In this paper we study instance-level update in extitDL-Lite _ A.
In particular we focus on formula-based approaches to ABox insertion and deletion.
we show that extitDL-Lite _ A enjoys a first-order rewritability property also for updates.
extitDL-Lite _ A which is well-known for enjoying first-order rewritability of query answering.
That is, every update can be reformulated into a set of deletion instructions computable through a non-recursive datalog program.
That is, every update can be reformulated into a set of insertion instructions computable through a non-recursive datalog program.
the ABox considered as a database.
Such a program is readily translatable into a first-order query over the ABox.
the ABox considered into sql.
By exploiting this result, we implement an update component for extitDL-Lite _ A- based systems.
By exploiting this result, we implement an update component for extitDL-Lite _ A- perform some experiments.
some experiments showing that the approach works in practice.
