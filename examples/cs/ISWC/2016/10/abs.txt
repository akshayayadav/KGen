In this paper we study instance-level update in 	extitDL-Lite_A , the description logic underlying the owl 2 ql standard. In particular we focus on formula-based approaches to ABox insertion and deletion. We show that 	extitDL-Lite_A , which is well-known for enjoying first-order rewritability of query answering, enjoys a first-order rewritability property also for updates. That is, every update can be reformulated into a set of insertion and deletion instructions computable through a non-recursive datalog program. Such a program is readily translatable into a first-order query over the ABox considered as a database, and hence into sql. By exploiting this result, we implement an update component for 	extitDL-Lite_A -based systems and perform some experiments showing that the approach works in practice.
