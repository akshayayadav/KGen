Navigational graph queries are an important class of queries.
queries that can extract implicit binary relations over the nodes of input graphs.
the navigational query languages used in the RDF community.
Most of the navigational query languages e.g. property paths in W3C SPARQL 1.1 are based on the regular expressions.
Most of the navigational query languages e.g. nested regular expressions in nSPARQL are based on the regular expressions.
It is known that regular expressions have limited expressivity; for instance, some natural queries, like same generation-queries, are not expressible with regular expressions.
To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we present cfSPARQL.
To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we present an extension of SPARQL query language.
SPARQL query language equipped with context-free grammars.
The cfSPARQL language is strictly more expressive than property paths.
The cfSPARQL language is strictly more expressive than nested expressions.
The additional expressivity can be used for modelling ontology alignment.
The additional expressivity can be used for modelling graph summarization.
The additional expressivity can be used for modelling graph similarities.
Despite The additional expressivity, we show that cfSPARQL still enjoys a low computational complexity.
Despite The additional expressivity, we show that cfSPARQL can be evaluated efficiently.
