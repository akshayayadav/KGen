Despite the emergence and growth of numerous large knowledge graphs, many important facts about our everyday world are not readily available on the Web.

commonsense knowledge that relies on joint learning from Web-scale data to fill gaps in the knowledge acquisition.
To address this, we present WebBrain.
To address this, we present a new approach for harvesting commonsense knowledge.
textual patterns found on the Web.
We train a neural network model to learn relations based on large numbers of textual patterns.
At the same time, a neural network model learns vector representations of general word semantics.
a new approach for harvesting commonsense knowledge allows us to generalize beyond the explicitly extracted information.

words that reflect Experiments semantics.
Experiments show that we can obtain representations of words yet also allow us to capture conceptual relationships.
