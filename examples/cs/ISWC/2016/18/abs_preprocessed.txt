The traversal-based approach to execute queries over Linked Data on the WWW fetches data by traversing data links and, thus, is able to make use of up-to-date data from initially unknown data sources.
the result set as soon as possible.
user perceived response time.
While the downside of The traversal-based approach to execute queries over Linked Data on the WWW is the delay before the query engine completes a query execution, user may be improved significantly by returning as many elements of the result.
To this end, the query engine requires a traversal strategy.
a traversal strategy that enables the engine to fetch result-relevant data as early as possible.
The challenge for such a strategy is that the query engine does not know a priori which of result-relevant data sources will contain result-relevant data.
sources discovered during the query execution.
In this paper, we investigate 14 different approaches to achieve a variety of traversal strategies.
In this paper, we investigate 14 different approaches to rank traversal steps.
We experimentally compare traversal strategies to a baseline.
a baseline that resembles a breadth-first traversal.
We experimentally study traversal strategies impact on response times.
While We experiments show that some of the approaches can achieve noteworthy improvements over the baseline in a significant number of cases, We also observe that for every approach, there is a non-negligible chance to achieve response times.
response times that are worse than the baseline.
