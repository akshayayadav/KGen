Finding relevant concepts from a corpus of ontologies is useful in many scenarios, such as web page annotation.
Finding relevant concepts from a corpus of ontologies is useful in many scenarios, such as automatic ontology population.
Finding relevant concepts from a corpus of ontologies is useful in many scenarios, such as document classification.
Many millions of concepts are contained in a large number of ontologies across diverse domains.
A SPARQL-based query demands the knowledge of the structure of ontologies whereas user-friendlier suffer from false positives.
A SPARQL-based query demands the knowledge of the structure of the query language whereas , simpler keyword-based approaches suffer from false positives.

A SPARQL-based query demands the knowledge of the structure of the query language whereas user-friendlier suffer from false positives.
This is because concept descriptions in ontologies may be ambiguous.
This is because concept descriptions in ontologies may overlap.
In this paper, we balances the relevance and diversity of search results.
a keyword-based concept search framework which exploits the structure.
a keyword-based concept search framework which exploits semantics.
In this paper, we propose a keyword-based concept search framework in ontologies, by constructing contexts for each concept; generates the interpretations of a query;.
A comprehensive evaluation against the domain-specific BioPortal demonstrates that our system outperforms both.
the general-purpose Falcons on widely-used performance metrics demonstrates that our system outperforms both.
