The unprecedented growth in mobile devices, combined with advances in Semantic Web Technologies, has given birth to opportunities for more intelligent systems on-the-go.
Limited resources of mobile devices demand approaches.
approaches that make mobile reasoning more applicable.
In this paper, we introduce an energy consumption prediction mechanism for ontology reasoning on mobile devices.
The developed prediction model contributes to mobileâ€“cloud integration.
The developed prediction model helps to improve further developments in semantic reasoning in general.
