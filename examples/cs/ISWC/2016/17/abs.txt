The unprecedented growth in mobile devices, combined with advances in Semantic Web (SW) Technologies, has given birth to opportunities for more intelligent systems on-the-go. Limited resources of mobile devices demand approaches that make mobile reasoning more applicable. While Mobile-Cloud integration is a promising method for harnessing the power of semantic technologies in the mobile infrastructure, it is an open question how to decide when to reason over ontologies on mobile devices. In this paper, we introduce an energy consumption prediction mechanism for ontology reasoning on mobile devices that allows an analysis of the feasibility of performing an ontology reasoning on a mobile device with respect to energy consumption. The developed prediction model contributes to mobileâ€“cloud integration and helps to improve further developments in semantic reasoning in general.
