The semantics distributed over large-scale knowledge bases can be used to intermediate heterogeneous users’ activity logs created in services; such information can be used to improve applications that can help users to decide the next activities/services. Since user activities can be represented in terms of relationships involving three or more things (e.g. a user tags movie items on a webpage), tensors are an attractive approach to represent them. The recently introduced Semantic Sensitive Tensor Factorization (SSTF) is promising as it achieves high accuracy in predicting users’ activities by basing tensor factorization on the semantics behind objects (e.g. item categories). However, SSTF currently focuses on the factorization of a tensor for a single service and thus has two problems: (1) the balance problem occurs when handling heterogeneous datasets simultaneously, and (2) the sparsity problem triggered by insufficient observations within a single service. Our solution, Semantic Sensitive Simultaneous Tensor Factorization (S^3TF), tackles the problems by: (1) Creating tensors for individual services and factorizing them simultaneously; it does not force the creation of a tensor from multiple services and factorize the single tensor. This avoids the low prediction accuracy caused by the balance problem. (2) Utilizing shared semantics behind distributed activity logs and assigning semantic bias to each tensor factorization. This avoids the sparsity problem by sharing semantics among services. Experiments using real-world datasets show that S^3TF achieves higher accuracy in rating prediction than the current best tensor method. It also extracts implicit relationships across services in the feature spaces by simultaneous factorization with shared semantics.
