Finding associations between entities is a common information need in many areas. It has been facilitated by the increasing amount of graph-structured data on the Web describing relations between entities. In this paper, we define an association connecting multiple entities in a graph as a minimal connected subgraph containing all of them. We propose an efficient graph search algorithm for finding associations, which prunes the search space by exploiting distances between entities computed based on a distance oracle. Having found a possibly large group of associations, we propose to mine frequent association patterns as a conceptual abstract summarizing notable subgroups to be explored, and present an efficient mining algorithm based on canonical codes and partitions. Extensive experiments on large, real RDF datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.
