Large-scale knowledge graphs provide excellent use-cases for ontologies.
Large-scale knowledge graphs are widely used in academia.
Large-scale knowledge graphs are widely used in industry.
We find, however, that popular ontology languages, such as Datalog can not express even the most basic relationships on the normalised data format of Large-scale knowledge graphs.
We find, however, that popular ontology languages, such as OWL can not express even the most basic relationships on the normalised data format of Large-scale knowledge graphs.
Existential rules may make reasoning undecidable.
Existential rules are more powerful.
Normalising Existential rules to suit Large-scale knowledge graphs often also destroys syntactic restrictions.
syntactic restrictions that ensure low complexity.
syntactic restrictions that ensure decidability.
We study this issue for several classes of existential rules.
We derive new syntactic criteria to recognise well-behaved rule-based ontologies over Large-scale knowledge graphs.
