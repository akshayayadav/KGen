The Linking Open Data project is an ongoing effort to construct a global data space, i.e. the Web of Data.

One important part of The Linking Open Data -RRB- project is to establish sameAs links among structured data sources.
Such links indicate equivalent instances.
equivalent instances that refer to the same real-world object.
The problem of discovering sameAs links between pairwise data sources is called instance matching.
The problem of discovering owl is called instance matching.

prior schema matching which is not always good enough in the Open Data scenario.
the existing approaches addressing The problem of discovering sameAs links between pairwise data sources.
Most of the existing approaches rely on the quality of prior schema matching.
In this paper, we propose a schema-independent instance-pair similarity metric based on several general descriptive features.
We transform the instance matching problem to the binary classification problem.
We solve the binary classification problem by machine learning algorithms.
Furthermore, we employ some transfer to reduce the demand for labeled data.
some transfer learning methods to utilize the existing owl.
some transfer learning methods to utilize sameAs links in Open Data.
We carry out experiments on some datasets of OAEI2010.
The results show that We method performs well on real-world Open Data data.
