In RDF, a blank node (or anonymous resource or bnode) is a node in an RDF graph which is not identified by a URI and is not a literal. Several RDF/S Knowledge Bases (KBs) rely heavily on blank nodes as they are convenient for representing complex attributes or resources whose identity is unknown but their attributes (either literals or associations with other resources) are known. In this paper we show how we can exploit blank nodes anonymity in order to reduce the delta (diff) size when comparing such KBs. The main idea of the proposed method is to build a mapping between the bnodes of the compared KBs for reducing the delta size. We prove that finding the optimal mapping is NP-Hard in the general case, and polynomial in case there are not directly connected bnodes. Subsequently we present various polynomial algorithms returning approximate solutions for the general case.
