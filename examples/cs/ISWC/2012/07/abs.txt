The distributed and heterogeneous nature of Linked Open Data requires flexible and federated techniques for query evaluation. In order to evaluate current federation querying approaches a general methodology for conducting benchmarks is mandatory. In this paper, we present a classification methodology for federated SPARQL queries. This methodology can be used by developers of federated querying approaches to compose a set of test benchmarks that cover diverse characteristics of different queries and allows for comparability. We further develop a heuristic called SPLODGE for automatic generation of benchmark queries that is based on this methodology and takes into account the number of sources to be queried and several complexity parameters. We evaluate the adequacy of our methodology and the query generation strategy by applying them on the 2011 billion triple challenge data set.
