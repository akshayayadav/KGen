links given the presence of mutual nodes.
Existing approaches for link prediction, in the domain of network science, exploit a network’s topology to predict future connections by inducing links.
Existing approaches for link prediction, in the domain of network science, exploit a network’s topology to predict future connections by assessing existing edges and connections.
Despite the rise in popularity of Attention-Information Networks ) no existing work has attempted to exploit the semantics of published content when predicting network links.
Despite the rise in popularity of i.e. microblogging platforms ) no existing work has attempted to exploit the semantics of published content when predicting network links.
Despite the rise in popularity of the production of content within such platforms no existing work has attempted to exploit the semantics of published content when predicting network links.
In this paper we present an approach.
models that rely solely on network topology information, and b ).
In this paper we present models.
an approach that fills this gap by a ) predicting follower edges within a directed social network by exploiting concept graphs.
an approach that fills this gap by a ) significantly outperforming a random baseline.
network topology information, and b ) assessing the different behaviour that users exhibit when making followee-addition decisions.
This latter contribution exposes latent factors within social networks.
the existence of a clear need for topical affinity between users for a follow link to be created.
