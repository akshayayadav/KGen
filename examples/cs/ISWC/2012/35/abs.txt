This paper presents an approach to automatically extract entities and relationships from textual documents. The main goal is to populate a knowledge base that hosts this structured information about domain entities. The extracted entities and their expected relationships are verified using two evidence based techniques: classification and linking. This last process also enables the linking of our knowledge base to other sources which are part of the Linked Open Data cloud. We demonstrate the benefit of our approach through series of experiments with real-world datasets.
