a system that incrementally executes SPARQL queries on a Hadoop cluster.
We describe a system.

a system that incrementally translates SPARQL queries to Pig Latin.
a system that incrementally executes them on a Hadoop cluster.
a system is designed to work efficiently on complex queries with many self-joins over huge datasets, avoiding job failures even in the case of joins with unexpected high-value skew.
To be robust against cost estimation errors, a system interleaves query optimization with query execution, determining the next steps to take based on statistics.

statistics gathered during the previous step.
a system that incrementally translates SPARQL queries to Pig Latin.
Furthermore, we have developed a novel skew-resistant join algorithm.
algorithm that replicates tuples.
tuples corresponding to popular keys.
a synthetic benchmark known to generate complex queries.
a Yahoo case of data analysis using RDF data crawled from the web.
We evaluate the effectiveness of We approach both on a synthetic benchmark as well as on a Yahoo case of data analysis.
We results indicate that a system is indeed capable of processing huge datasets without pre-computed statistics while exhibiting good load-balancing properties.
