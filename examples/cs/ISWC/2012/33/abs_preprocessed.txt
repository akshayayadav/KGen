these matching tools have emerged that automate this task.
The inherent heterogeneity of datasets on the Semantic Web has created a need to interlink The inherent heterogeneity of datasets on the Semantic Web.
In this paper we are interested in what happens if we enrich these matching tools with knowledge of the domain of the ontologies.
we explore how to express the notion of a domain in terms usable for an ontology matching tool.
we examine various methods to determine what constitutes the domain of a given dataset.
We show how to use this in a matching tool.
We show how to study the effect of domain knowledge on the quality of the alignment.
