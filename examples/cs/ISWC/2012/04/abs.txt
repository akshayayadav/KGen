We present Tìpalo, an algorithm and tool for automatically typing DBpedia entities. Tìpalo identifies the most appropriate types for an entity by interpreting its natural language definition, which is extracted from its corresponding Wikipedia page abstract. Types are identified by means of a set of heuristics based on graph patterns, disambiguated to WordNet, and aligned to two top-level ontologies: WordNet supersenses and a subset of DOLCE+DnS Ultra Lite classes. The algorithm has been tuned against a golden standard that has been built online by a group of selected users, and further evaluated in a user study.
