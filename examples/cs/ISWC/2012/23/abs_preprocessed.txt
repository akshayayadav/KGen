Time-efficient algorithms are essential to address the complex.
tasks that arise when trying to discover links on the Web of Data.
the complex linking tasks.
Although several lossless approaches have been developed for this exact purpose, Time-efficient algorithms do not offer theoretical guarantees with respect to Time-efficient algorithms performance.
In this paper, we address this drawback by presenting the first Link Discovery approach with theoretical quality guarantees.
In particular, we prove that given an achievable reduction ratio r, we Link Discovery approach HR3 can achieve a reduction ratio r ′ ≤ r in a metric space where distances are measured by the means of a Minkowski metric of any order p ≥ 2.
the HYPPO algorithm implemented in LIMES 0.5 with respect to the number of comparisons they carry out.
We compare HR3.
In addition, we compare we approach with Time-efficient algorithms LIMES SILK 2.5 with respect to runtime.
In addition, we compare we approach with Time-efficient algorithms LIMES 0.5 to runtime.
Time-efficient algorithms implemented in the state-of-the-art frameworks.
we show that HR3 outperforms these previous approaches with respect to runtime in each of we four experimental setups.
