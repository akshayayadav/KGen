A key issue in semantic reasoning is the computational complexity of inference tasks on expressive ontology languages such as OWL 2 DL.
Theoretical works have established worst-case complexity results for reasoning tasks for expressive ontology languages such as OWL DL and OWL 2 DL.
However, hardness of reasoning about individual ontologies has not been adequately characterised.
In this paper, we conduct a systematic study to tackle this problem using machine learning techniques, covering over four state-of-the-art, widely-used OWL 2 reasoners.
In this paper, we conduct a systematic study to tackle this problem using machine learning techniques, covering over 350 real-world ontologies.
we main contributions are two-fold.
Firstly, we learn various classifiers.
various classifiers that accurately predict classification time for an ontology based on an ontology metric values.
metrics that can be used to effectively predict reasoning performance.
Secondly, we identify a number of metrics.
we prediction models have been shown to be highly effective, achieving an accuracy of over 80.
