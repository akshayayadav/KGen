The amount of data available in the Linked Data cloud continues to grow.
Yet, few services consume linked data.
Yet, few services produce linked data.
producing linked data requires specialized knowledge of SPARQL.
recent work that allows a user to define a linked service from an online service.
building such models is time consuming.

This paper presents a new approach.
a new approach that allows domain experts to rapidly create semantic models of services by demonstration in an interactive web-based interface.
First, the user provides examples of the service request URLs.
Then, the system automatically proposes a service model the user can refine interactively.
a service specification using a new expressive vocabulary.
a new expressive vocabulary that includes lowering rules.
Finally, the system saves a service specification.
a new expressive vocabulary that includes lifting rules.
