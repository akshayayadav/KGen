The lightweight ontology language OWL RL is used for reasoning with large amounts of data.
To this end, the W3C standard provides a simple system of deduction rules.
deduction rules which operate directly on the RDF syntax of OWL.
Several similar systems have been studied.
However, these approaches are usually complete for instance retrieval only.
This paper asks if such methods could also be used for computing.

computing entailed subclass relationships.
tractable rule-based reasoning is possible when restricting to subsumptions between atomic classes.
Checking entailment for arbitrary OWL RL class subsumptions is co-NP-hard.
Surprisingly.
the W3C calculus can not be extended to compute all atomic class subsumptions.
however, this can not be achieved in any RDF-based rule system.
a rule system that is sound for many OWL RL ontologies.
