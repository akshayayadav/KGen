First order logic (FOL) rewritability is a desirable feature for query answering over geo-thematic ontologies because in most geo-processing scenarios one has to cope with large data volumes. Hence, there is a need for combined geo-thematic logics that provide a sufficiently expressive query language allowing for FOL rewritability. The DL-Lite family of description logics is tailored towards FOL rewritability of query answering for unions of conjunctive queries, hence it is a suitable candidate for the thematic component of a combined geo-thematic logic. We show that a weak coupling of DL-Lite with the expressive region connection calculus RCC8 allows for FOL rewritability under a spatial completeness condition for the ABox. Stronger couplings allowing for FOL rewritability are possible only for spatial calculi as weak as the low-resolution calculus RCC2. Already a strong combination of DL-Lite with the low-resolution calculus RCC3 does not allow for FOL rewritability.
