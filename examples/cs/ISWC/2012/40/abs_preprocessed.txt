FOL ) rewritability is a desirable feature for query answering over geo-thematic ontologies because in most geo-processing scenarios one has to cope with large data volumes.
First order logic ) rewritability is a desirable feature for query answering over geo-thematic ontologies because in most geo-processing scenarios one has to cope with large data volumes.
a sufficiently expressive query language allowing for FOL rewritability.
Hence, there is a need for combined geo-thematic logics.
combined geo-thematic logics that provide a sufficiently expressive query language.
The DL-Lite family of description logics is tailored towards FOL rewritability of query answering for unions of conjunctive queries, hence The DL-Lite family of description logics is a suitable candidate for the thematic component of a combined geo-thematic logic.
We show that a weak coupling of DL-Lite with the expressive region connection calculus RCC8 allows for FOL rewritability under a spatial completeness condition for the ABox.
Stronger couplings allowing for FOL rewritability.
Stronger couplings are possible only for spatial calculi as weak as the low-resolution calculus RCC2.
Already a strong combination of DL-Lite with the low-resolution calculus RCC3 does not allow for FOL rewritability.
