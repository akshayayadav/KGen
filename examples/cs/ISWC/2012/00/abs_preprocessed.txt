Classification is a fundamental reasoning task in ontology design.
there is currently a wide range of reasoners highly optimised for classification of OWL 2 ontologies.
several reasoners that are complete for restricted fragments of OWL 2, such as the OWL 2 EL profile.
There are also several reasoners.
several reasoners that are complete for restricted fragments of OWL 2, such as the OWL 2 EL profile are not.
several reasoners complete for ontologies.
several reasoners that are complete for restricted fragments of OWL 2, such as the OWL 2 EL profile are much more efficient than several reasoners.
ontologies containing axioms outside the relevant fragment.
several reasoners that are complete for restricted fragments of OWL 2, such as the OWL 2 EL profile are much more efficient than fully-fledged OWL 2 reasoners.
a novel classification technique that combines an OWL 2 reasoner for a given fragment in such a way that the bulk of the workload is assigned to the latter.
a novel classification technique that combines an efficient reasoner for a given fragment in such a way that the bulk of the workload is assigned to the latter.
In this paper, we propose a novel classification technique.
the specifics of Reasoners implementation are irrelevant to we approach.
Reasoners are combined in a black-box modular manner.
