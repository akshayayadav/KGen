We propose a framework for querying probabilistic instance data in the presence of an OWL2 QL ontology, arguing that the interplay of ontologies is fruitful in many applications such as managing data.

The prime inference problem is computing answer probabilities.
it can be implemented using standard probabilistic database systems.
We establish a PTime vs. # P dichotomy for the data complexity of The prime inference problem by lifting a corresponding result from probabilistic databases.
We also show that non-existence of a rewriting into first-order logic implies # P-hardness.
We also demonstrate that query rewriting ( backwards chaining ) is an important tool for our framework.
We also briefly discuss approximation of answer probabilities.
