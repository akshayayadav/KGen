RE ) system which learns grammar-based RE rules from the Web by utilizing large numbers of relation instances as seed.
We present a large-scale relation extraction ) system.

We present RE ) system.
We goal is to obtain rule sets large enough to cover the actual range of linguistic variation, thus tackling the long-tail problem of real-world applications.
A variant of distant supervision learns several relations in parallel.
several relations in parallel enabling a new method of rule filtering.
RE -RRB- system detects both n-ary relations.
RE -RRB- system detects both binary relations.

RE -RRB- system which learns grammar-based RE rules from the Web by utilizing large numbers of relation instances as seed.
We target 39 relations from Freebase.
3M sentences extracted from 20M web pages.
Freebase for which 3M sentences serve as the basis for learning an average of 40K distinctive rules per relation.
Employing an efficient dependency parser, the average run time for each relation is only 19 hours.
We demonstrate that the Web is indeed needed for a good coverage of linguistic variation.
We compare these rules with ones.
ones learned from local corpora of different sizes.
