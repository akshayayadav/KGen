Three conflicting requirements arise in the context of knowledge base (KB) extraction: the size of the extracted KB, the size of the corresponding signature and the syntactic similarity of the extracted KB with the original one. Minimal module extraction and uniform interpolation assign an absolute priority to one of these requirements, thereby limiting the possibilities to influence the other two. We propose a novel technique for EL that does not require such an extreme prioritization. We propose a tractable rewriting approach and empirically compare the technique with existing approaches with encouraging results.
