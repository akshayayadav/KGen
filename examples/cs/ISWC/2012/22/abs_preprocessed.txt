Tracking user interests over time is important for making accurate recommendations.
However, the widely-used time-decay-based approach worsens the sparsity problem because the widely-used time-decay-based approach deemphasizes old item transactions.
We introduce two ideas to solve the sparsity problem.
First, we divide the users’ transactions into epochs i.e. time periods.
epochs that are dominated by interests similar to the current interests of the active user.
First, we identify epochs.
similar transactions that exist in prior epochs.
Thus, the users' can eliminate dissimilar transactions while making use of similar transactions.
Second, we use a taxonomy of items to model user item transactions in each epoch.
This well captures the interests of users in each epoch even if there are few transactions.
the semantics behind classes do not change so often while individual items often appear.
the situations in which the items transacted by users.
This suits the situations dynamically change over time do not change so often while individual items often appear.

Fortunately, many taxonomies are now available on the web because of the spread of the Linked Open Data vision.
We can now use those to understand dynamic user interests semantically.

The results show that our method predicts user interests much more accurately than the previous time-decay-based method.
