JeuxDeMots is a rich collaborative lexical network in built on a crowdsourcing principle as a game with a purpose, represented in an ad-hoc tabular format.
In the interest of reuse, we propose a conversion algorithm for JeuxDeMots following the Ontolex model, along with called JdMBabelizer, that anchors JeuxDeMots sense-refinements to synsets in the lemon edition of BabelNet and thus to the Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud.
In the interest of interoperability, we propose a conversion algorithm for JeuxDeMots following the Ontolex model, along with called JdMBabelizer, that anchors JeuxDeMots sense-refinements to synsets in the lemon edition of BabelNet and thus to the Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud.
a conversion algorithm for JeuxDeMots following the Ontolex model, along with a word sense alignment algorithm, called JdMBabelizer, that anchors JeuxDeMots sense-refinements to synsets in the lemon edition of BabelNet and thus to the Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud exploits the richness of JeuxDeMots in terms of weighted semantic-lexical relations-- particularly the inhibition relation between senses-- that are specific to JeuxDeMots.
Our produce a reference alignment dataset for JeuxDeMots and BabelNet that Our use to evaluate the quality of a conversion algorithm for called JdMBabelizer, that anchors JeuxDeMots sense-refinements to synsets in the lemon edition of BabelNet and thus to the Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud and that Our make available to the community.
The obtained results are comparable to those of state of the art approaches.
