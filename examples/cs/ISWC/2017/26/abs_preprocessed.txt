SPARQL query answering in ontology-based data access is carried out by translating into SQL queries over the data source.
Standard translation techniques try to transform the user query into a union of conjunctive queries, following the heuristic argument that UCQs can be efficiently evaluated by modern relational database engines.
In this work, we show that translating to UCQs is not always the best choice, and that, under certain conditions on the interplay between the ontology, alternative translations can be evaluated much more efficiently.

In this work, we show that translating to UCQs is not always the best choice, and that, under certain conditions on the interplay between the statistics of the data, alternative translations can be evaluated much more efficiently.
To find the best translation, we devise a cost model together with a novel cardinality estimation that takes into account all such SPARQL query answering in ontology-based data access components.
we experiments confirm that alternatives to the best translation might produce queries that are orders of magnitude more efficient, and the cost model we propose is faithful to the actual query evaluation cost, and hence is well suited to select the best translation.
