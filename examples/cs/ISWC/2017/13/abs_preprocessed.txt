Ontology-based Data Access is gaining importance both practically.
Ontology-based Data Access is gaining importance both scientifically.
However, little attention has been paid so far to the problem of updating Ontology-based Data Access systems.
This is an essential issue if we want to be able to cope with modifications of data both at the ontology and at the source level, while maintaining the independence of the data sources.
In this paper, we propose mechanisms to properly handle updates in this context.
we show that updating data both at the source level is first-order rewritable.
we show that updating data both at the ontology level is first-order rewritable.
we also provide a practical implementation of updating mechanisms based on non-recursive Datalog.
