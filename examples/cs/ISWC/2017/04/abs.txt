The Web of Data is an inherently distributed environment where ontologies are located in (physically) remote locations and are subject to constant changes. Reasoning is affected by these changes, but the extent and significance of this dependency is not well-studied yet. To address this problem, this paper presents an empirical study on how the distribution of ontological data on the Web affects the outcome of reasoning. We study (1) to what degree datasets depend on external ontologies and (2) to what extent the inclusion of additional ontological information via IRI de-referencing and the owl:imports directive to the input datasets leads to new derivations.
