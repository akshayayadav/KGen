This paper explores whether Authoring Tests derived from Competency Questions accurately represent the expectations of ontology authors. In earlier work we proposed that an ontology authoring interface can be improved by allowing the interface to test whether a given Competency Question (CQ) is able to be answered by the ontology at a given stage of its construction, an approach known as CQ-driven Ontology Authoring (CQOA). The experiments presented in the present paper suggest that CQOA’s understanding of CQs matches users’ understanding quite well, especially for inexperienced ontology authors.
