the present paper explores whether derived from Competency Questions accurately represent the expectations of ontology authors.
In earlier work we proposed that an ontology authoring interface can be improved by allowing the interface to test whether a given Competency Question is able to be answered by the ontology at a given stage of a given Competency Question construction, an approach known as CQ-driven Ontology Authoring -LRB- the interface to test whether a given Competency Question -LRB- CQ -RRB- is able to be answered by the ontology at a given stage of a given Competency Question -LRB- CQ -RRB- construction, an approach known as CQ-driven Ontology Authoring -RRB-.
The experiments presented in the present paper suggest that the interface to test whether a given Competency Question -LRB- CQ -RRB- is able to be answered by the ontology at a given stage of a given Competency Question -LRB- CQ -RRB- construction, an approach known as CQ-driven Ontology Authoring's understanding of CQs matches users' understanding quite well, especially for inexperienced ontology authors.
