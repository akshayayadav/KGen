Nanopublications are a concept to represent Linked Data in a granular and provenance-aware manner, which has been successfully applied to a number of scientific datasets.
We demonstrated in previous work how We can establish reliable identifiers for nanopublications thereof.
We demonstrated in previous work how We can establish verifiable identifiers for nanopublications thereof.
We demonstrated in previous work how We can establish reliable identifiers for sets thereof.

Further adoption of these techniques, however, was probably hindered by the fact that nanopublications can lead to an explosion in the number of triples due to auxiliary information about the structure of repetitive provenance and metadata.
Further adoption of these techniques, however, was probably hindered by the fact that nanopublications can lead to an explosion in the number of triples due to auxiliary information about the structure of each nanopublication.
We demonstrate here that this significant overhead disappears once We allow users to deal with the specific subsets users need.
We demonstrate here that this significant overhead disappears once We take the version history of nanopublication datasets into account, calculate incremental updates.
We show that the total size and overhead of evolving scientific datasets is reduced, and typical subsets that researchers use for the total size and overhead of evolving scientific datasets analyses can be referenced and retrieved efficiently with optimized precision, persistence, and reliability.
