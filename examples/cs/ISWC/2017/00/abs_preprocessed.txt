A growing number of highly optimized reasoning algorithms have been developed to allow inference tasks on expressive ontology languages such as OWL.
Nevertheless, there is broad agreement that a reasoner could be optimized for all the ontologies.
Nevertheless, there is broad agreement that a reasoner could be optimized for some.
This particular fact makes it hard to select the best performing reasoner to handle a given ontology, especially for novice users.
In this paper, we present our introduced ranking method.
we generates a recommendation in the form of reasoner ranking.
The efficiency as well as the correctness are our main ranking criteria.
Our solution combines and adjusts multi-target regression techniques.
Our solution combines and adjusts multi-label classification.
A large collection of 10 well-known reasoners are studied.
A large collection of ontologies are studied.
The experimental results show that our introduced ranking method performs significantly better than several state-of-the-art ranking solutions.
Furthermore, The experimental results proves that our introduced ranking method could effectively be evolved to a competitive meta-reasoner.
