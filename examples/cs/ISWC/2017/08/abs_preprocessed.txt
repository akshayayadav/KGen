When crises hit, many flog to social media to consume information related to the event.
Social media posts during crises tend to provide valuable reports on affected people, donation offers, help requests, advice provision.
Automatically identifying the category of information contained in Social media posts is vital for Social media posts efficient handling and consumption by effected communities and concerned organisations.
In this paper, we introduce Sem-CNN; designed for identifying the category of information contained in crisis-related social media content.
Unlike previous models, which mainly rely on the lexical representations of words in the text, the proposed model integrates an additional layer of semantics that represents the named entities in the text, into a wide and deep CNN network.
Results show that the proposed model consistently outperforms the baselines which consist of statistical and non-semantic deep learning models.
