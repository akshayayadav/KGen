The Linked Data Fragment -LRB- LDF -RRB- framework has been proposed as a uniform view to explore the trade-offs of consuming Linked Data when servers provide different interfaces to access servers data.
this new LDF interface has this new LDF interface own particular properties regarding performance, bandwidth needs, caching.
Several practical challenges arise.
For example, before exposing a new type of LDFs in some server, can we formally say something about how this new LDF interface compares to other interfaces previously implemented in the same server?
From the client side, given a client with some restricted capabilities in terms of time constraints, which is the best type of LDFs to complete a given task?
From the client side, given a client with some restricted capabilities in terms of network connection, which is the best type of LDFs to complete a given task?
From the client side, given a client with some restricted capabilities in terms of computational power, which is the best type of LDFs to complete a given task?
Today there are only a few formal theoretical tools to help answer other practical questions, and researchers have embarked in solving researchers mainly by experimentation.
