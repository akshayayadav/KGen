A prominent approach to implementing ontology-mediated queries is to rewrite into a first-order query, which is then executed using a conventional SQL database system.
We consider the case where the ontology is formulated in the description logic and the actual query is a conjunctive query.
We show that rewritings of such ontology-mediated queries can be efficiently computed in practice, in a sound.
We show that rewritings of such ontology-mediated queries can be efficiently computed in practice, in complete way.
We consider the case where the ontology is formulated in the description logic and the actual query is a conjunctive query.
A prominent approach to implementing ontology-mediated queries combines a reduction with a decomposed backwards chaining algorithm for ontology-mediated queries that are based on the simpler atomic queries, also illuminating the relationship between first-order rewritings of ontology-mediated queries based on conjunctive and on atomic queries.
Experiments with real-world ontologies show promising results.
