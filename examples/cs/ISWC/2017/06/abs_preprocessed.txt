We present a formal semantics and proof of soundness for shapes schemas, an expressive schema language for RDF graphs that is the foundation of Shape Expressions Language 2.0.
It can be used to constrain the admissible properties for nodes in that graph.
It can be used to describe the structure of an RDF graph.
It can be used to constrain the admissible values for nodes in that graph.
It can be used to describe the structure of an RDF graph.
It can be used to describe the vocabulary.
It can be used to constrain the admissible properties for nodes in that graph.
It can be used to describe the vocabulary.
It can be used to constrain the admissible values for nodes in that graph.
The language defines called shapes against which nodes of the graph can be checked.
The language includes an algebraic grouping operator for the number of allowed occurrences of a property.
The language includes cardinality constraints for the number of allowed occurrences of a property.
The language includes a choice operator for the number of allowed occurrences of a property.
Shapes can be combined using Boolean operators.
Shapes can use possibly recursive references to other shapes.
