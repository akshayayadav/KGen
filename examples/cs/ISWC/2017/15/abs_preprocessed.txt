Web tables constitute ranging from Web search to Knowledge Base -LRB- KB -RRB- augmentation.
An underlying common requirement is to annotate the rows of Web tables with semantically rich descriptions of published in Web KBs.
In this paper, we evaluate three unsupervised annotation methods: -LRB- a -RRB- a lookup-based method which relies on the minimal entity context provided in Web tables to discover correspondences to the KB, -LRB- b -RRB- a semantic embeddings method that exploits a vectorial representation of the rich entity context in a KB to identify the most relevant subset of entities in the Web table, and -LRB- c -RRB- an ontology matching method, which exploits schematic and instance information of entities available both in a KB and a Web table.
we experimental evaluation is conducted using two existing benchmark data sets in addition to created using Wikipedia tables.
we results show that: -LRB- 1 -RRB- we novel lookup-based method outperforms state-of-the-art lookup-based methods, -LRB- 2 -RRB- the semantic embeddings method outperforms lookup-based methods in set, and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the lack of a rich schema in Web tables can limit the ability of ontology matching tools in performing high-quality table annotation.
As a result, we propose a hybrid method that significantly outperforms individual methods on all the benchmarks.
