Knowledge Graphs effectively capture explicit relational knowledge about individual entities.
However, visual attributes of those entities, like those entities, like their shape and color concerning their usage in natural language shape and color concerning those entities, like their shape and color concerning their usage in natural language usage in natural language are not covered.
However, visual attributes of those entities, like those entities, like their shape and color concerning their usage in natural language shape and color concerning those entities, like pragmatic aspects concerning their usage in natural language usage in natural language are not covered.

Recent approaches encode such knowledge by learning latent representations -LRB- ` embeddings' -RRB- separately: In computer vision, visual object features are learned from large image collections and in computational linguistics, word embeddings are extracted from huge text corpora which capture word embeddings distributional semantics.
We investigate the potential of complementing the relational knowledge captured in Knowledge Graph embeddings with knowledge from text documents and images by learning a shared latent representation that integrates information across those modalities.
We empirical results show that a joined concept representation provides measurable benefits for semantic similarity benchmarks, since a joined concept representation shows a higher correlation with the human notion of similarity than unimodal representations, since a joined concept representation clearly outperforms plain Knowledge Graph embeddings.

These findings encourage further research towards capturing types of knowledge that go beyond today's Knowledge Graphs.
