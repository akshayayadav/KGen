Wikipedia infoboxes are thus a very rich source of structured knowledge.
Wikipedia infoboxes contain information about article entities in the form of attribute-value pairs.
However, as the different language versions of Wikipedia evolve independently, it is a challenging problem to find correspondences between infobox attributes in different language editions.

In this paper, we propose containing categories, templates, attribute labels.

We propose entity-attribute factor graph to consider not only the correlations among attribute pairs.

Experiments on the two Wikipedia data sets of English-Chinese and English-French show that proposed approach can achieve high F1-measure: 85.5 % and 85.4 % respectively on the two data sets.
Our proposed approach finds 23,923 new infobox attribute mappings between Chinese Wikipedia, and 31,576 between French based on no more than six thousand existing matched infobox attributes.
