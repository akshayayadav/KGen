Federated querying, the idea to execute queries over several distributed knowledge bases, lies at the core of the semantic web vision.
To accommodate the semantic web vision, SPARQL provides the SERVICE keyword that allows one to allocate sub-queries to servers.
In many cases, however, data may be available from resulting in a combinatorially growing number of alternative allocations of subqueries to sources.
Running a federated query on all possible sources might not be very lucrative from a user's point of view if extensive execution times or fees are involved in accessing all possible sources data.
To address this shortcoming, federated join-cardinality approximation techniques have been proposed to narrow down the number of possible allocations to a few most promising -LRB- or results-yielding -RRB- ones.
