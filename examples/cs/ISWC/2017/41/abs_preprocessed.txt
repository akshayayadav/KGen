In this paper we present SPREFQL, an extension of the SPARQL language that allows appending a `` PREFER '' clause that expresses ` soft ' preferences over the query results obtained by the main body of the query.
an extension of the SPARQL language that allows appending a `` PREFER '' clause that expresses ` soft ' preferences over the query does not add expressivity and any SPREFQL query can be transformed to an equivalent standard SPARQL query.
However, clearly separating preferences from the ` hard ' patterns and filters in the `` WHERE '' clause gives queries where the intention of the client is more cleanly expressed, an advantage for both machine optimization.

In this paper we present SPREFQL we formally define the syntax and the semantics of an extension of the SPARQL language that allows appending a `` PREFER '' clause that expresses ` soft ' preferences over the query and we also provide empirical evidence that optimizations specific to SPREFQL improve run-time efficiency by comparison to the usually applied optimizations on the equivalent standard SPARQL query.
