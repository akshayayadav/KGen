This paper investigates meta structures, schema-level graphs that abstract connectivity information among a set of entities in a knowledge graph.
Meta structures are useful in a variety of ranging from relatedness explanation to data retrieval.
We formalize the meta structure computation problem.
We devise efficient automata-based algorithms.
We introduce a meta structure-based relevance measure, which can retrieve entities related to those in input.
We implemented We machineries in called MEKoNG.
We report on an extensive experimental evaluation, which confirms the suitability of We proposal from both the efficiency and effectiveness point of view.
