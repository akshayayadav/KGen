Vector space embeddings have been shown to perform well when using RDF data in data mining.
Vector space embeddings have been shown to perform well when using RDF data in learning tasks.
Existing approaches, such as RDF2Vec, use local information, i.e., Existing approaches, such as RDF2Vec, use local information, i.e., rely on generated for nodes in the RDF graph.
For word embeddings, global techniques, such as GloVe, have been proposed as an alternative.
In this paper, we show that the results are competitive with traditional local techniques like RDF2Vec.
In this paper, we show how the idea of global embeddings can be transferred to RDF embeddings.
