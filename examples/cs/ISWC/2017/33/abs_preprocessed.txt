Automated acquisition of ontologies from data has attracted research interest because Automated acquisition of ontologies from data can complement manual, expensive construction of ontologies.
We investigate the problem of General Terminology Induction in OWL, i.e. acquiring general, expressive TBox axioms from an ABox.
We define designed to rigorously evaluate the quality of general, expressive TBox axioms while respecting the standard semantics of OWL.
We propose an informed, data-driven algorithm that constructs class expressions for general, expressive TBox axioms in guarantees completeness.
We propose an informed, data-driven algorithm that constructs class expressions for general, expressive TBox axioms in OWL completeness.
We empirically evaluate the quality measures on two corpora of ontologies and run a case study with a domain expert to gain insight into applicability of the measures and acquired general, expressive TBox axioms.
The results show that the measures capture different quality aspects and not only correct general, expressive TBox axioms can be interesting.
