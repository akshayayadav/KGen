OWL is recognized as the de facto standard notation for ontology engineering.
The Manchester OWL Syntax was developed as an alternative to symbolic description logic and it is believed to be more effective for users.
This paper sets out to test that belief from two perspectives by evaluating how accurately and quickly people understand the informational content of axioms.
This paper sets out to derive inferences from people.
By conducting a between-group empirical study, involving 60 novice participants, we found that symbolic description logic is just as effective as The Manchester OWL Syntax for people's understanding of axioms.
Moreover, for two types of inference problems, symbolic description logic supported significantly better task performance than The Manchester OWL Syntax, yet The Manchester OWL Syntax never significantly outperformed symbolic description logic.
These surprising results suggest that the belief that The Manchester OWL Syntax is more effective than symbolic description logic, at least for these types of task, is unfounded.
An outcome of this research is the suggestion that ontology axioms, when presented to non-experts, may be better presented in symbolic description logic rather than The Manchester OWL Syntax.
Further empirical studies are needed to explain These surprising results.
Further empirical studies are needed to see whether Further empirical studies hold for other types of task.
