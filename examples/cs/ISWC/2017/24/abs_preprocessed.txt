In modelling real-world knowledge, there often arises a need to represent.
In modelling real-world knowledge, there often arises reason with meta-knowledge.
To equip description logics for dealing with such ontologies, we enrich description logic concepts and roles with finite sets of attribute-value pairs, called annotations.
To equip description logics for dealing with such ontologies, we allow concept inclusions to express constraints on annotations.
we show that this may lead to even undecidability, and we identify cases where this increased expressivity can be achieved without incurring increased complexity of reasoning.

In particular, we describe a tractable fragment based on the lightweight description logic, and we cover the description logic underlying OWL description logic.
