Knowledge graphs (KGs) are huge collections of primarily encyclopedic facts. They are widely used in entity recognition, structured search, question answering, and other important tasks. Rule mining is commonly applied to discover patterns in KGs. However, unlike in traditional association rule mining, KGs provide a setting with a high degree of incompleteness, which may result in the wrong estimation of the quality of mined rules, leading to erroneous beliefs such as all artists have won an award, or hockey players do not have children.
