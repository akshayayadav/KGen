An increasing number of use cases require a timely extraction of non-trivial knowledge from semantically annotated data streams, especially on the Web and for the Internet of Things.
Often, a timely extraction of non-trivial knowledge requires expressive reasoning, which is challenging to compute on large streams.
We propose Laser, a new reasoner that supports a pragmatic, non-trivial fragment of the logic LARS which extends Answer Set Programming for streams.
At Laser, a new reasoner that supports a pragmatic, non-trivial fragment of the logic LARS which extends Answer Set Programming for streams core, Laser implements a novel evaluation procedure which annotates formulae to avoid the re-computation of duplicates at multiple time points.
a novel evaluation procedure which annotates formulae to avoid the re-computation of duplicates at multiple time points is responsible for significantly better runtimes than the ones of other state-of-the-art systems like C-SPARQL and CQELS, or an implementation of LARS which runs on the Programming solver Clingo.
This opens the door to a wider range of stream reasoning use cases.
This enables the application of expressive logic-based reasoning to large streams.
