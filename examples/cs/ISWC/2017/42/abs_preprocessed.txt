Cross-lingual taxonomy alignment refers to mapping each category in the source taxonomy of one language onto a ranked list of most relevant categories in the target taxonomy of another language.
Recently, vector similarities depending on bilingual topic models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance on Cross-lingual taxonomy alignment.
However, bilingual topic models only model the textual context of categories, but ignore explicit category correlations, such as correlations between the categories and co-occurring words in text or correlations among the categories of ancestor-descendant relationships in a taxonomy.
In this paper, we propose a unified solution to encode category correlations into bilingual topic modeling for Cross-lingual taxonomy alignment, which brings two novel category correlation based bilingual topic models, called CC-BiLDA and CC-BiBTM.
Experiments on two real-world datasets show our proposed models significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines on Cross-lingual taxonomy alignment -LRB- at least +10.9 % in each evaluation metric -RRB-.
