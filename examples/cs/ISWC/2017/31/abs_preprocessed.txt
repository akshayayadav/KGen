Wikidata is a collaboratively-edited knowledge graph; Wikidata expresses knowledge in the form of subject-property-value triples, which can be enhanced with references to add provenance information.
Understanding the quality of Wikidata is key to Wikidata widespread adoption as a knowledge resource.
We analyse one aspect of Wikidata quality, provenance, in terms of authoritativeness of Wikidata external references.
We analyse one aspect of Wikidata quality, provenance, in terms of relevance of Wikidata external references.
We follow a two-staged approach.
First, We perform a crowdsourced evaluation of references.
Second, We use collected in the first stage to train learning model to predict reference quality on a large-scale.
chosen for The machine learning models were related to reference the semantics of the triples the triples referred to.
chosen for The machine learning models were related to reference editing the triples referred to.
\ -LRB- 61 \ % \ -RRB- of the references evaluated were relevant and authoritative.
Bad references were often links that changed and either stopped working or pointed to other pages.
The machine learning models outperformed the baseline.
The machine learning models were able to accurately predict non-relevant references.
The machine learning models were able to accurately predict non-authoritative references.
Further work should focus on implementing our approach in Wikidata to help editors find bad references.
