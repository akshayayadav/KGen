The emergent Semantic Web, despite being in The emergent Semantic Web infancy, has already received a lot of attention from academia.
The emergent Semantic Web, despite being in The emergent Semantic Web infancy, has already received a lot of attention from industry.
This resulted in discussion.
This resulted in an abundance of prototype systems.
discussion most of which are centred around the underlying infrastructure.
However, when we critically review the work we realise that there is little discussion with respect to the vision of The emergent Semantic Web.
the work done to date.
In particular, there is an observed dearth of discussion on how to deliver knowledge sharing in an environment such as the Semantic Web in efficient manners.

There are a lot of overlooked issues.
hidden assumptions made with respect to knowledge representation.
overlooked issues associated with trust to hidden assumptions.
overlooked issues associated with agents to hidden assumptions.
hidden assumptions made with respect to robust reasoning in a distributed environment.
overlooked issues could potentially hinder further development if not considered at the early stages of designing Semantic Web systems.

In this perspectives’ paper, we aim to help engineers of The emergent Semantic Web by raising awareness of overlooked issues.
