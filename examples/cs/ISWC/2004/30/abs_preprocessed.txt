We focus on the induction and revision of terminologies from metadata.
the search space expressed in a structural representation.
Following a Machine Learning approach, this setting can be cast as a search problem to be solved employing operators aiming at correct concept definitions.
operators that traverse the search space.
The progressive refinement of such definitions in a terminology is driven by the available extensional knowledge.
Description Logics which are endowed with well-founded reasoning capabilities.
the expressive Semantic Web representations based on Description Logics.
A knowledge-intensive inductive approach to this task is presented, that can deal with on the expressive Semantic Web representations.
The core inferential mechanism based on multilevel counterfactuals.
The core inferential mechanism can be used for either inducing new concept descriptions or refining existing ones.
