The semantic Web Services vision requires that each service be annotated with semantic metadata.
Manually creating such metadata is error-prone.
Manually creating such metadata is tedious.
many software engineers might not want to invest the additional effort.
many software engineers accustomed to tools.
tools that automatically generate WSDL.
We therefore propose ASSAM's, a tool.
a tool that assists a user in creating semantic metadata for Web Services.
service consumers who therefore must annotate a number of services according to some shared ontology.
service consumers who want to integrate a number of services.
ASSAM's is intended for service consumers.
ASSAM's is also relevant for service producers.
ASSAM's want to make ASSAM's compatible with an existing ontology.
service producers who have deployed a Web Service.
ASSAMâ€™s capabilities to automatically create semantic metadata are supported by two machine learning algorithms.
First, ASSAM's have developed an iterative relational classification algorithm for semantically classifying ASSAM's operations.
First, ASSAM's have developed an iterative relational classification algorithm for semantically classifying Web Services.
First, ASSAM's have developed an iterative relational classification algorithm for semantically classifying input messages.
First, ASSAM's have developed an iterative relational classification algorithm for semantically classifying output messages.
Second, to aggregate the data have developed a schema mapping algorithm.
the data returned by multiple semantically related Web Services, ASSAM's.
a schema mapping algorithm that is based on an ensemble of string distance metrics.
