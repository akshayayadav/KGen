We have seen an increasing amount of interest in the application of Semantic Web technologies to Web services.
The aim is to support automated discovery and composition of the services.
the services allowing transparent interoperability.
the services allowing seamless interoperability.
three projects that are applying such technologies to bioinformatics.
In this paper we discuss three projects MOBY-Services.
In this paper we discuss three projects Semantic-MOBY.
In this paper we discuss three projects myGrid.
Through an examination of the differences and similarities between the solutions produced, we suggest that the experiences with three projects myGrid have implications for the development of Semantic Web services as a whole.
Through an examination of the differences and similarities between the solutions produced, we suggest that the experiences with three projects Semantic-MOBY have implications for the development of Semantic Web services as a whole.

Through an examination of the differences and similarities between the solutions produced, we highlight some of the practical difficulties in developing Semantic Web services.
