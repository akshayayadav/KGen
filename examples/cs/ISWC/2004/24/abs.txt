We have seen an increasing amount of interest in the application of Semantic Web technologies to Web services. The aim is to support automated discovery and composition of the services allowing seamless and transparent interoperability. In this paper we discuss three projects that are applying such technologies to bioinformatics: ^myGrid, MOBY-Services and Semantic-MOBY. Through an examination of the differences and similarities between the solutions produced, we highlight some of the practical difficulties in developing Semantic Web services and suggest that the experiences with these projects have implications for the development of Semantic Web services as a whole.
