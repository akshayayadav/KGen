This paper introduces a visual, UML-based notation for OWL ontologies.
the language primitives offered by OWL DL.
a standard MOF2 compliant metamodel which captures the language primitives.
We provide a standard MOF2 compliant metamodel.
a notation that is close to the UML notation.
Similarly, We invent a UML profile.
a UML profile which allows to visually model OWL ontologies in a notation.
ontologies using UML tools.
This allows to develop ontologies.
Throughout This paper, the significant differences to some earlier proposals for a visual, UML-based notation for ontologies are discussed.
