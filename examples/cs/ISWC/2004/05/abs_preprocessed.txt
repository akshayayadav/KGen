We show that the Semantic Web needs a formal semantics for the various kinds of links between ontologies.
We show that the Semantic Web needs a formal semantics for the various kinds of links between other documents.
theoretic semantics that takes into account ontology extension.
We provide a model theoretic semantics.
theoretic semantics that takes into ontology versioning.
Since the Semantic Web is the product of a diverse community, as opposed to a single agent, this semantics accommodates different viewpoints by having different entailment relations for different ontology perspectives.
We discuss how this theory can be practically applied to OWL.
a theorem that shows how to compute perspective-based entailment using existing logical reasoners.
We discuss how this theory can be practically applied to RDF.
We discuss how this theory can provide a theorem.
We illustrate these concepts using examples.
We conclude with a discussion of future work.
