Successful employment of semantic web services depends on the availability of high quality ontologies to describe the domains of semantic web services.
As always, building such ontologies is difficult thus hampering web service deployment.

the functionality offered by a web service.
Our hypothesis is that since the functionality is reflected by the underlying software, the extracted ontologies could be built by analyzing the documentation of the underlying software.
Our verify this hypothesis in the domain of RDF ontology storage tools.
Our fine-tuned a semi-automatic method to extract domain ontologies from software documentation.
Our implemented.
The quality of the extracted ontologies was verified against a high quality hand-built ontology of the same domain.
Despite the low linguistic quality of the corpus, Our method allows extracting a considerable amount of information for a domain ontology.
