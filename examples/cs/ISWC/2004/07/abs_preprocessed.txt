Life science researchers increasingly rely on the web as a primary source of data use as to an experiment in the laboratory.
data forcing Life science researchers to apply the same rigor to Life science researchers.
The myGrid project is developing the use of provenance to describe how results were produced.
The myGrid project is developing the use of workflows to explicitly capture web-based procedures.
The myGrid project is developing the use of provenance to describe why results were produced.
Experience within myGrid has shown that this provenance metadata is formed from a complex web of heterogenous resources.
heterogenous resources that impact on the production of a result.
Therefore we have used existing initiatives such as Jena to store such material.
Therefore we have used existing initiatives such as LSID to generate such material.
Therefore we have used existing initiatives such as LSID to store such material.
Therefore we have explored the use of Semantic Web technologies such as RDF, and ontologies to support ontologies representation.
Therefore we have used existing initiatives such as Jena to generate such material.
The effective presentation of complex RDF graphs is challenging.
Haystack has been used to provide multiple views of provenance metadata.
provenance metadata that can be further annotated.
a case study showing how existing Semantic Web tools can effectively support the emerging requirements of life science research.
This work therefore forms a case study.
