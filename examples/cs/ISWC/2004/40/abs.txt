We propose a personal knowledge publishing system called Semblog is realized with integration of Semantic Web techniques and Weblog tools. Semblog suite provides an integrated environment for gathering, authoring, publishing, and making human relationship seamlessly to enable people to exchange information and knowledge with easy and casual fashion. We use a lightweight metadata format like RSS to activate the information flow and its activities. We define three level of interest of information gathering and publishing i.e., “check”, “clip” and “post” and provide suitable ways to distribute information depending on the interest level. Our system called Semblog platform consists of two types of extended content aggregator and information retrieval / recommendation applications. We also design a new metadata module to define personal ontology that realizes semantic relations among people and Weblog sites.
