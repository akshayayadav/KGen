In this paper, we present an abstract conceptual architecture for semantic web services.
we define requirements on an abstract conceptual architecture for semantic web services by analyzing a set of case studies developed as part of the EU Semantic Web-enabled Web Services project.
an abstract conceptual architecture for semantic web services is developed as a refinement and extension of the W3C Web Services Architecture.
We assess the W3C Web Services Architecture against the requirements.
We provide an analysis of OWL-S.
