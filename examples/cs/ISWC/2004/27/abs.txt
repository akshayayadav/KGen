In this paper, we present an abstract conceptual architecture for semantic web services. We define requirements on the architecture by analyzing a set of case studies developed as part of the EU Semantic Web-enabled Web Services project. The architecture is developed as a refinement and extension of the W3C Web Services Architecture. We assess our architecture against the requirements, and provide an analysis of OWL-S.
