We argue that in a distributed context, such as the Semantic Web, ontology engineers and data creators often can not control ( or even imagine ) the possible uses creators ontologies might have.
We argue that in a distributed context, such as the Semantic Web, ontology engineers and data creators often can not control ( or even imagine ) the possible uses creators data might have.
for example these might be of a personalised nature.
for example these might be appropriate for a certain user in a certain context.
Therefore ontologies are unlikely to identify every useful classification possible in a problem domain.
Therefore ontologies are unlikely to identify every interesting classification possible in a problem domain.
these might be of a different granularity than the initial scope of the ontology.
We argue that machine learning techniques will be essential within the Semantic Web context to allow these unspecified classifications to be identified.
In this paper We explore the application of machine learning methods to FOAF, highlighting the challenges.
the challenges posed by the characteristics of such data.
Specifically, we use clustering to identify classes of people to learn descriptions of these groups.
Specifically, we use clustering to identify classes of inductive logic programming to learn descriptions of these groups.
We argue that These new descriptions constitute re-usable, first class knowledge.
re-usable, first class knowledge that deducible from the input data.
re-usable, first class knowledge that is neither explicitly stated.
These new descriptions can be represented as simple OWL class restrictions using SWRL.
These new descriptions can be represented as more sophisticated descriptions using SWRL.
These are then suitable either for incorporation into future versions of ontologies.
These are then suitable either for on-the-fly use for personalisation tasks.
