Turning the current Web into a Semantic Web requires automatic approaches for annotation of existing data since manual approaches will not scale in general. We here present an approach for automatic generation of F-Logic frames out of tables which subsequently supports the automatic population of ontologies from table-like structures. The approach consists of a methodology, an accompanying implementation and a thorough evaluation. It is based on a grounded cognitive table model which is stepwise instantiated by our methodology.
