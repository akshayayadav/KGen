Information retrieval can contribute towards the construction of ontologies and the effective usage of ontologies. We use collocation-based keyword extraction to suggest new concepts, and study the generation of hyperlinks to automate the population of ontologies with instances. We evaluate our methods within the setting of digital library project, using information retrieval evaluation methodology. Within the same setting we study retrieval methods that complement the navigational support offered by the semantic relations in most ontologies to help users explore the ontology.
