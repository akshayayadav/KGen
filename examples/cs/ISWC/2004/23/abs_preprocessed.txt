Hierarchical Task-Network have been applied to the problem of composing Web Services.
Hierarchical Task-Network based planning techniques.
Web Services especially when described using the OWL âˆ’ S service ontologies.
Many of the existing Web Services are either exclusively information providing.
Many of the existing Web Services depend on information-providing services.
Thus, many interesting service compositions involve collecting information either during execution the composition process itself.
Thus, many interesting service compositions involve collecting information either during the composition process the composition process itself.
In this paper, we focus on the latter issue.
an HTN-planning algorithm designed for planning domains.
In particular, we present an HTN-planning algorithm.
planning domains in which the information about the initial state of the world may not be complete.
the information about the initial state of the world is discoverable through plan-time information-gathering queries.
In particular, we present ENQUIRER.
the plan found.
we have derived several mathematical relationships among the amount of available information.
we have shown that ENQUIRER is sound.
the planner finding the plan.
we have derived the quality of the plan.
we have shown that ENQUIRER is complete.
the plan found.
we have derived the likelihood of the planner.
we have performed experimental tests that demonstrated how ENQUIRER can be used in Web Service composition.
we have performed experimental tests that confirmed we theoretical results.
