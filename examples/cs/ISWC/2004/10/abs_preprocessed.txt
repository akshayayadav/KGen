Increasing the number of peers in a peer-to-peer network usually increases the number of answers to a given query as well.
While having more answers is nice in principle, users are not interested in unordered answer sets.
While having more answers is nice in principle, users are not interested in a small set of “ best ” answers.
While having more answers is nice in principle, users are not interested in arbitrarily large answer sets.
peer-to-peer networks which makes use of local rankings, rank merging.
Inspired by the success of ranking algorithms in top-k query evaluation algorithms in databases, we propose a decentralized top-k query evaluation algorithm for peer-to-peer networks.
Inspired by the success of ranking algorithms in Web search engine in databases, we propose a decentralized top-k query evaluation algorithm for peer-to-peer networks.
both answer set network traffic among peers.
peer-to-peer networks which minimizes both answer.
both answer set size traffic among peers.
peer-to-peer networks which makes use of local rankings, rank optimized routing based on peer ranks.
As our algorithm is based on dynamically collected query statistics only, no continuous index update processes are necessary, allowing our algorithm to scale easily to large numbers of peers.
