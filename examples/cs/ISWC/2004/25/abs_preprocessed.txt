Semantic Grids based on high-level goal specification.
We present a framework to facilitate automated synthesis of scientific experiment workflows in Semantic Grids.
two main features which distinguish Our framework from other work in this area.
We framework has two main features.
First, We propose a dynamic mechanism for automating the construction of experiment workflows.
First, We propose a adaptive mechanism for automating the construction of experiment workflows.
Second, We distinguish between different levels of abstraction of loosely coupled experiment workflows to facilitate reuse of experiments.
Second, We distinguish between different levels of abstraction of loosely coupled experiment workflows to facilitate sharing of experiments.
the physics domain involving the detection of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources.
We illustrate Our framework using a real world application scenario in the physics domain.
