An analysis of OWL ontologies represented in RDF/XML on the Web shows that a majority are OWL Full. In many cases this may not be through a desire to use the expressivity provided by OWL Full, but is rather due to syntactic errors or accidental misuse of the vocabulary. We present a “rogues gallery” of common errors encountered, and describe how robust parsers that attempt to cope with such errors can be produced.
