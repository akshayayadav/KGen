In this paper, we present an evaluation of four knowledge base systems with respect to use in large OWL applications.
To our knowledge, no experiment has been done with the scale of data.
data used here.
999 files totaling 583 MB.
The smallest dataset used consists of 15 OWL files totaling 8 MB, while The smallest dataset consists of 999 files.

our describe how our have performed the evaluation.
our describe what factors our have considered in the evaluation.
our show the results of the experiment.
our discuss the performance of each system.
In particular, our have concluded that existing systems need to place a greater emphasis on scalability.
