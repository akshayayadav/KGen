The increasing awareness of the benefits of these ontologies has lead to the creation of a number of large ontologies about real-world domains.
The size of these ontologies.
The size of these ontologies monolithic character cause serious problems in handling these ontologies.
In other areas, e.g. these ontologies serious problems in handling them are tackled by partitioning monolithic entities into sets of meaningful modules.
In other areas, e.g. software engineering serious problems in handling them are tackled by partitioning monolithic entities into sets of meaningful modules.
In other areas, e.g. their monolithic character cause serious problems in handling them are tackled by partitioning monolithic entities into sets of meaningful modules.
In other areas, e.g. software engineering serious problems in handling them are tackled by partitioning monolithic entities into sets of mostly self-contained modules.

In other areas, e.g. these ontologies serious problems in handling them are tackled by partitioning monolithic entities into sets of mostly self-contained modules.
In this paper, we suggest a similar approach for ontologies.
smaller modules based on the structure of the class hierarchy.
We propose a method for automatically partitioning large ontologies into smaller modules.
We show that the structure-based method performs surprisingly well on real-world ontologies.
We support this claim by these experiments carried out on.

SUMO.
We support this claim by these experiments carried out on real-world ontologies.
