a knowledge-based environment that enables information to be retrieved effectively.
a knowledge-based environment that enables information to be shared effectively.
Semantic Web provides a knowledge-based environment.
In this research, we propose the Scholarly Semantic Web for the sharing, reuse and management of scholarly information.
data which is a difficult task.
To support the Scholarly Semantic Web for the sharing, reuse and management of scholarly information, we need to construct ontology from data.
data which is a tedious task.
To generate ontology automatically, Formal Concept Analysis is an effective technique.
an effective technique that can formally abstract data as conceptual structures.
To enable Formal Concept Analysis to deal with uncertainty in data we propose to incorporate fuzzy logic into Formal Concept Analysis for automatic generation of ontology.
To enable Formal Concept Analysis to interpret the concept hierarchy reasonably we propose to incorporate fuzzy logic into Formal Concept Analysis for automatic generation of ontology.
The proposed new framework is known as Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis.
In this paper, we will discuss the ontology generation process from The proposed new framework.
In this paper, we will discuss reuse of scholarly information.
In this paper, we will discuss the Scholarly Semantic Web for the sharing.
In this paper, we will discuss management of scholarly information.
In addition, the performance of the Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis framework for ontology generation will also be presented.
In addition, the performance of the Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis framework for ontology generation will also be evaluated.
