Semantic Web provides a knowledge-based environment that enables information to be shared and retrieved effectively. In this research, we propose the Scholarly Semantic Web for the sharing, reuse and management of scholarly information. To support the Scholarly Semantic Web, we need to construct ontology from data which is a tedious and difficult task. To generate ontology automatically, Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is an effective technique that can formally abstract data as conceptual structures. To enable FCA to deal with uncertainty in data and interpret the concept hierarchy reasonably, we propose to incorporate fuzzy logic into FCA for automatic generation of ontology. The proposed new framework is known as Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis (FFCA). In this paper, we will discuss the Scholarly Semantic Web, and the ontology generation process from the FFCA framework. In addition, the performance of the FFCA framework for ontology generation will also be evaluated and presented.
