We introduce the OWL Plugin, a Semantic Web extension of the Protégé ontology development platform. The OWL Plugin can be used to edit ontologies in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), to access description logic reasoners, and to acquire instances for semantic markup. In many of these features, the OWL Plugin has created and facilitated new practices for building Semantic Web contents, often driven by the needs of and feedback from our users. Furthermore, Protégé’s flexible open-source platform means that it is easy to integrate custom-tailored components to build real-world applications. This document describes the architecture of the OWL Plugin, walks through its most important features, and discusses some of our design decisions.
