One approach to this problem, however, raises a number of challenges.
This paper addresses these challenges in the context of a case study carried out on our fully-deployed system for semantic email agents.
our describe how high-level features of our template language enable the concise specification of flexible goals.
These results both suggest general issues and techniques.
general issues and techniques that may be applicable in other Semantic Web systems.
These results both improve the usefulness of semantic email.
