Bibster exploits ontologies in data storage, query formulation, query When bibliographic entries are made available for use in a Peer-to-Peer system for exchanging bibliographic data among researchers, bibliographic entries are classified according to two different ontologies.
This ontological structure is then exploited to help users formulate users queries.
Subsequently, two different ontologies are used to improve query.
query routing across the Peer-to-Peer network.
Finally, two different ontologies are used to post-process the returned answers in order to do duplicate detection.
This paper describes each of these ontology-based aspects of a Peer-to-Peer system for exchanging bibliographic data among researchers.
