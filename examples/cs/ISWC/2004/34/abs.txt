The purpose of this paper is to provide a rigorous comparison of six query languages for RDF. We outline and categorize features that any RDF query language should provide and compare the individual languages along these features. We describe several practical usage examples for RDF queries and conclude with a comparison of the expressiveness of the particular query languages. The use cases, sample data and queries for the respective languages are available on the web [6].
