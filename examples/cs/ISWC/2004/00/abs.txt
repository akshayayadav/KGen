This talk explores aspects relevant for peer-to-peer search infrastructures, which we think are better suited to semantic web search than centralized approaches. It does so in the form of an (incomplete) cookbook recipe, listing necessary ingredients for putting together a distributed search infrastructure. The reader has to be aware, though, that many of these ingredients are research questions rather than solutions, and that it needs quite a few more research papers on these aspects before we can really cook and serve the final infrastructure. Weâ€™ll include appropriate references as examples for the aspects discussed (with some bias to our own work at L3S), though a complete literature overview would go well beyond cookbook recipe length limits.
