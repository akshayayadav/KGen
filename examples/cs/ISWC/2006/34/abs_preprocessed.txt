Social networks have recently garnered considerable interest.
With the intention of utilizing social networks for the Semantic Web, several studies have examined automatic extraction of social networks.
However, most methods have addressed extraction of the strength of relations.
entities that are embedded in social networks.
Our goal is extracting the underlying relations between entities.
To this end, Our propose The proposed method.
Fundamentally, the method clusters similar entity pairs according to the method clusters collective contexts in Web documents.
The descriptive labels for relations are obtained from results of clustering.
The proposed method is entirely unsupervised.
The proposed method is easily incorporated into existing social network extraction methods.
The proposed method also contributes to ontology population by elucidating relations between instances in social networks.
Our experiments conducted on the entities.
Our experiments achieved clustering with high precision and recall.
Our extracted appropriate relation labels to represent the entities.
