The technical challenges have been subject to a considerable number of research initiatives since the beginning of the nineties.
The technical challenges associated with the development and deployment of ontologies.
The economical aspects of these processes are, however, still poorly exploited, impeding the dissemination of ontology-driven technologies beyond the boundaries of the academic community.
the costs arising in ontology engineering processes.
This paper aims at contributing to the alleviation of this situation by proposing a model to predict the costs.
This paper aims at contributing to the alleviation of this situation by proposing ONTOCOM ).
This paper aims at contributing to the alleviation of this situation by proposing Ontology Cost Model ).
We introduce an inventory of cost drivers.
activities performed during an ontology life cycle.
We introduce a methodology to generate a cost model adapted to a particular ontology development strategy.
cost drivers which influence the amount of effort.
effort invested in activities.
36 data points collected from real-world projects.
We further present the results of the model validation procedure.
the model validation procedure which covered an expert-driven evaluation on 36 data points.
the model validation procedure which covered a statistical calibration on 36 data points.
The validation revealed that ontology engineering processes have a high learning rate.
a high learning rate indicating that the building of very large ontologies is feasible from an economic point of view.
Moreover, the complexity of domain analysis proved to have a major impact on the final ontology engineering process duration.
Moreover, the complexity of conceptualization activities proved to have a major impact on the final ontology engineering process duration.
Moreover, the complexity of ontology evaluation proved to have a major impact on the final ontology engineering process duration.
