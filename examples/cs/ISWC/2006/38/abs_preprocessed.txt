With the wider use of ontologies as part of production systems multiple scenarios for ontology maintenance and evolution are emerging.
With the wider use of ontologies in the Semantic Web multiple scenarios for ontology maintenance and evolution are emerging.
rejecting managers of projects before a new baseline is published.
ontology-development in a collaborative environment can be asynchronous.
examining changes from previous baseline versions is published.
users discovering the new versions serendipitously.
accepting managers of projects before a new baseline is published.
managers of projects may exercise quality control.
ontology-development in a collaborative environment can be synchronous.
successive ontology versions can be posted on the Semantic Web.
For each scenario, we discuss the high-level tasks that an editing environment must support.
We then present a unified comprehensive set of tools to support different scenarios in a single framework, allowing users to switch between different modes easily.
