This paper presents an approach for visually modeling OWL DL and OWL Full ontologies based on the well-established visual modeling language UML.
OWL based on the Meta-Object Facility.
We discuss a metamodel for OWL.
We discuss an associated UML profile as visual syntax.
We discuss transformations between both.
The work we present is currently undergoing the standardization process of the Object Management Group.
The work we present supports model-driven development of OWL ontologies.
