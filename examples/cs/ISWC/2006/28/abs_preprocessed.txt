conjunctive queries composed of triple patterns over RDF data.
We study the problem of evaluating conjunctive queries stored in distributed hash tables.
We goal is to develop algorithms.
algorithms that scale to large amounts of RDF data.
We goal is to incur little network traffic.
We goal is to distribute the query processing load evenly.
We present two novel query processing algorithms with these possibly conflicting goals in mind.
We evaluate two novel query processing algorithms with these possibly conflicting goals in mind.
We discuss the various tradeoffs.
the various tradeoffs that occur in We.
We setting through a detailed experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms.
