The casual user is typically overwhelmed by the formal logic of the Semantic Web.
The gap between the end user has to be bridged if the Semantic Web capabilities are to be utilized by the general public.
The gap between the logic-based scaffolding has to be bridged if the Semantic Web capabilities are to be utilized by the general public.
This paper proposes that controlled natural languages offer one way to bridge The gap between the end user.

natural language ontology editor that allows users to query ontologies in a language akin to English.
We introduce a guided input natural language ontology editor.
We introduce GINO.
natural language ontology editor that allows users to edit ontologies in a language akin to English.
This paper uses a small static grammar.
a small static grammar which This paper dynamically extends with elements from the loaded ontologies.
natural language ontology editor that allows users to edit ontologies in a language akin to English.
The usability evaluation shows that GINO is well-suited for novice users when editing ontologies.

thehabitability problem which adversely affects most natural language systems.
We believe that the use of guided entry overcomes thehabitability problem.
Additionally, the approachâ€™s dynamic grammar generation allows for easy adaptation to new ontologies.
