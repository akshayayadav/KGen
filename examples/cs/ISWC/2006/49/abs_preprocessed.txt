OWL ontologies present many interesting visualization challenges.
a technique designed to view the class hierarchies in ontologies as trees.
Here we present a technique.
Here we present CropCircles.
we place special emphasis on topology understanding.
topology understanding when designing the tool.
we drew inspiration from treemaps.
we made substantial changes in the representation and layout.
Most notably, the spacefillingness of treemap is relaxed in exchange for visual clarity.
we outline the problem scape of visualizing ontology hierarchies.
the requirements that go into the design of the tool.
we note the requirements.
we discuss the interface and implementation.
a controlled experiment involving tasks common to understanding ontologies.
Finally, through a controlled experiment we show the benefits of we design.
