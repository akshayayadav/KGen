Resource access control is crucial to leverage these ad-hoc collaborations.
collaborating entities can not be predetermined.
In pervasive scenarios.
however.
resource availability frequently varies, even unpredictably, due to userdevice mobility, thus complicating resource access control.
Access control policies can not be specified a priori to face any operative run time condition.
Access control policies require continuous adjustments to adapt to the current situation.
Access control policies can not be defined based on entityâ€™s identitiesroles, as in traditional access control solutions,.
To address these issues, this paper advocates semantic technologies for contextpolicy specification to allow high-level description and reasoning about context.
novel access control policy models that follow two main design guidelines.
To address these issues, this paper advocates semantic technologies for contextpolicy specification to allow high-level description and reasoning about policies.
To address these issues, this paper advocates the adoption of novel access control policy models.
To address these issues, this paper advocates context-awareness to enable dynamic adaptation of policies depending on context changes.
To address these issues, this paper advocates context-awareness to control resource access on the basis of context visibility.
