In this paper, we show how to use ontologies to bootstrap a knowledge acquisition process.
a knowledge acquisition process that extracts product information from tabular data on Web pages.
Furthermore, we use logical rules to reason about product specific properties.
Furthermore, we use logical rules to to derive higher-order knowledge about product features.
We will also explain the knowledge acquisition process.
the knowledge acquisition process covering both procedural aspects.
the knowledge acquisition process covering both ontological aspects.
Finally, We will give an quantitative evaluation of We results.
Finally, We will give an qualitative evaluation of We results.
