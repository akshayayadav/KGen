In this paper, we show how to use ontologies to bootstrap a knowledge acquisition process that extracts product information from tabular data on Web pages. Furthermore, we use logical rules to reason about product specific properties and to derive higher-order knowledge about product features. We will also explain the knowledge acquisition process, covering both ontological and procedural aspects. Finally, we will give an qualitative and quantitative evaluation of our results.
