heterogeneity problems have to be solved at the ontological level.
In a semantic environment data is described by ontologies.
This means that alignments between ontologies have to be created, most probably during design-time.
This means that alignments between ontologies have to be used in various run-time processes.
Such alignments describe a set of mappings between the source ontologies, where the mappings show how instance data from one ontology can be expressed in terms of another ontology.
Such alignments describe a set of mappings between the target ontologies, where the mappings show how instance data from one ontology can be expressed in terms of another ontology.
We propose a formal model for mapping creation.
a design-time graphical tool that can be used in creating alignments between ontologies.
Starting from a formal model we explore how such a model maps onto a design-time graphical tool.
We also investigate how such a model helps in expressing the mappings in a logical language, based on the semantic relationships.
the semantic relationships identified using the graphical tool.
