Logic programming is often seen as a way to overcome several shortcomings of the Web Ontology Language, such as the inability to model integrity constraints.
Logic programming is often seen as a way to perform closed-world querying.
However, the open-world semantics of the Web Ontology Language seems to be fundamentally incompatible with the closed-world semantics of Logic programming.
This has sparked a heated debate in the the Semantic Web community.
alternative ontology languages based entirely on logic programming.
a heated debate in the the Semantic Web community resulting in proposals for alternative ontology languages.
To help resolving a heated debate in the Semantic Web community, we investigate the practical use cases.
the practical use cases which seem to be addressed by logic programming.
In fact, many of these requirements have already been addressed outside the Semantic Web.
By drawing inspiration from these existing formalisms, we present a novel logic of hybrid MKNF knowledge bases.
hybrid MKNF knowledge bases which seamlessly integrates the Web Ontology Language with Logic programming.
we are thus capable of addressing the identified use cases without a radical change in the architecture of the Semantic Web.
