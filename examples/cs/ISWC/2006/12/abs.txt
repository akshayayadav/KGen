We present a framework for designing and developing Semantic Web Service applications that span over several enterprises by applying techniques, methodologies, and notations offered by Software engineering, Web engineering, and Business Process modeling. In particular, we propose to exploit existing standards for the specification of business processes (e.g., BPMN), for modeling the cross enterprise process, combined with powerful methodologies, tools and notations (e.g., WebML) borrowed from the Web engineering field for designing and developing semantically rich Web applications, with semi-automatic elicitation of semantic descriptions (i.e., WSMO Ontologies, Goals, Web Services and Mediators) from the design of the applications, with huge advantages in terms of efficiency of the design and reduction of the extra work necessary for semantically annotating the information crossing the organization boundaries.
