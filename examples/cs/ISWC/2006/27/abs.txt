Automated composition of Web services or the process of forming new value added Web services is one of the most promising challenges in the semantic Web service research area. Semantics is one of the key elements for the automated composition of Web services because such a process requires rich machine-understandable descriptions of services that can be shared. Semantics enables Web service to describe their capabilities and processes, nevertheless there is still some work to be done. Indeed Web services described at functional level need a formal context to perform the automated composition of Web services. The suggested model (i.e., Causal link matrix) is a necessary starting point to apply problem-solving techniques such as regression-based search for Web service composition. The model supports a semantic context in order to find a correct, complete, consistent and optimal plan as a solution. In this paper an innovative and formal model for an AI planning-oriented composition is presented.
