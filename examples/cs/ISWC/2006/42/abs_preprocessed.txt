We claim that user preferences are a key component of Web service composition– a component.
Web service composition– a component that has largely been ignored.
In this paper We propose a means of intergrating user preferences into Web service composition.
In this paper We propose a means of specifying user preferences into Web service composition.
To this end, we propose a means of performing automated Web service composition by exploiting generic procedures together with rich qualitative user preferences.
We exploit the agent programming language Golog to represent We generic procedures to represent rich qualitative temporal user preferences.
We exploit the agent programming language Golog to represent We a first-order preference language to represent rich qualitative temporal user preferences.
Web service compositions that realize the generic procedure, satisfying the user’s hard constraints.
Web service compositions that realize the generic procedure, optimizing for the user's preferences.
From these We generate Web service compositions.
We prove We approach sound.
We prove We approach optimal.
We system, GologPref, is interacting with services on the Web.
We system, GologPref, is implemented.
The language and techniques can be integrated into a variety of approaches to Grid service composition.
The language and techniques proposed in this paper.
The language and techniques can be integrated into a variety of approaches to Web.
