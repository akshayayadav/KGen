SPARQL is the W3C candidate recommendation query language for RDF.
the formal study of SPARQL concentrating in SPARQL graph pattern facility.
In this paper we address systematically the formal study of SPARQL.
we consider for the formal study of SPARQL simple RDF graphs without a simplified version of filters.
we consider for the formal study of SPARQL simple RDF graphs without special semantics for literals.
filters which encompasses all the main issues.
we provide a compositional semantics, prove there are normal forms, prove complexity bounds, among others that the evaluation of SPARQL patterns is PSPACE-complete, compare we semantics to an alternative operational semantics, give natural conditions when our semantics coincide optimization procedures.
