Part-whole relations are important in many domains, but typically receive less attention than subsumption relation. In this paper we describe a method for finding part-whole relations. The method consists of two steps: (i) finding phrase patterns for both explicit and implicit part-whole relations, and (ii) applying these patterns to find part-whole relation instances. We show results of applying this method to a domain of finding sources of carcinogens.
