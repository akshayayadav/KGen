an approach that unifies browsing by visual features for intuitive exploration of image databases.
We propose an approach.
an approach that unifies browsing by tags for intuitive exploration of image databases.
In contrast to traditional image retrieval approaches, we utilise tags provided by users on collaborative tagging sites.
collaborative tagging sites complemented by simple image analysis.
collaborative tagging sites complemented by classification.
This allows us to find new relations between data elements.
a navigation map that describes links between data elements for the example of the collaborative tagging site Flickr.
We introduce the concept of a navigation map.
a navigation map that describes links between users.
a navigation map that describes links between tags.
We show that introducing similarity search based on image features yields additional links on this map.
We system using tags from real Flickr users.

We system using data from real Flickr users.
These theoretical considerations are supported by examples.
