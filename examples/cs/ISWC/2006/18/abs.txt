The goal of the work presented in this paper is to obtain large amounts of semistructured data from the web. Harvesting semistructured data is a prerequisite to enabling large-scale query answering over web sources. We contrast our approach to conventional web crawlers, and describe and evaluate a five-step pipelined architecture to crawl and index data from both the traditional and the Semantic Web.
