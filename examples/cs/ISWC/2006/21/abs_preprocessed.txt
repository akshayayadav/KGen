Ontology matching is a crucial task to enable interoperation between Web applications using related ontologies.
Ontology matching is a crucial task to enable interoperation between Web applications using different ontologies.
Today, most of the ontology matching techniques are targeted to find 1:1 mappings.
However, block mappings are in fact more pervasive.
In this paper, we discuss the block matching problem.
In this paper, we suggest that both the should be considered in block matching.
both the mapping quality.
both the mapping the partitioning quality.
We propose a novel partitioning-based approach to address the block matching issue.
a novel partitioning-based approach uses a hierarchical bisection algorithm for partitioning.
domain entities based on virtual documents.
a novel partitioning-based approach considers both structural characteristics of domain entities.
a novel partitioning-based approach considers both linguistic characteristics of domain entities.
We set up two kinds of metrics to evaluate of the quality of block matching.
The experimental results demonstrate that We approach is feasible.
