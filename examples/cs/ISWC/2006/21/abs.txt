Ontology matching is a crucial task to enable interoperation between Web applications using different but related ontologies. Today, most of the ontology matching techniques are targeted to find 1:1 mappings. However, block mappings are in fact more pervasive. In this paper, we discuss the block matching problem and suggest that both the mapping quality and the partitioning quality should be considered in block matching. We propose a novel partitioning-based approach to address the block matching issue. It considers both linguistic and structural characteristics of domain entities based on virtual documents, and uses a hierarchical bisection algorithm for partitioning. We set up two kinds of metrics to evaluate of the quality of block matching. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach is feasible.
