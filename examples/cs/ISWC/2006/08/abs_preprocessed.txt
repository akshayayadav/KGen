Semantic annotations of web services can facilitate services composition into workflows.
Semantic annotations of web services can facilitate the discovery of services.
At present, however, the practical utility of such annotations is limited by the small number of service annotations available for general use.
therefore some means is required by which services can be automatically ( or semi-automatically ) annotated.
Resources for manual annotation are scarce.
In this paper, we show how information can be inferred about the semantics of operation parameters.
operation parameters based on this paper connections to annotated ) operation parameters within tried-and-tested workflows.
operation parameters based on this paper connections to other ) operation parameters within tried-and-tested workflows.
these so-called loose annotations are still of value in detecting errors within workflows.
In an open-world context, we can infer only constraints on the semantics of parameters.
these so-called loose annotations are still of value in detecting errors within ontologies.
