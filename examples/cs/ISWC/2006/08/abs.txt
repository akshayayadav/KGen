Semantic annotations of web services can facilitate the discovery of services, as well as their composition into workflows. At present, however, the practical utility of such annotations is limited by the small number of service annotations available for general use. Resources for manual annotation are scarce, and therefore some means is required by which services can be automatically (or semi-automatically) annotated. In this paper, we show how information can be inferred about the semantics of operation parameters based on their connections to other (annotated) operation parameters within tried-and-tested workflows. In an open-world context, we can infer only constraints on the semantics of parameters, but these so-called loose annotations are still of value in detecting errors within workflows, annotations and ontologies, as well as in simplifying the manual annotation task.
