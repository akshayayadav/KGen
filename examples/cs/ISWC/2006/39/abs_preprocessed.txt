Data on the Semantic Web does not follow one.
Data on the Semantic Web is semi-structured.
one fixed schema.
Faceted browsing is a natural technique for navigating such data, partitioning the information space into orthogonal conceptual dimensions.
Current faceted interfaces are manually constructed.
Current faceted interfaces have limited query expressiveness.
We develop an expressive faceted interface for semi-structured data.
We formally show the improvement over existing interfaces.
metrics for automatic ranking of facet quality bypassing the need for manual construction of the interface.
Secondly, We develop metrics for automatic ranking of facet quality.
We develop RDF.
Experimental evaluation shows improved usability over current interfaces.
