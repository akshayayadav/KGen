Data on the Semantic Web is semi-structured and does not follow one fixed schema. Faceted browsing [23] is a natural technique for navigating such data, partitioning the information space into orthogonal conceptual dimensions. Current faceted interfaces are manually constructed and have limited query expressiveness. We develop an expressive faceted interface for semi-structured data and formally show the improvement over existing interfaces. Secondly, we develop metrics for automatic ranking of facet quality, bypassing the need for manual construction of the interface. We develop a prototype for faceted navigation of arbitrary RDF data. Experimental evaluation shows improved usability over current interfaces.
