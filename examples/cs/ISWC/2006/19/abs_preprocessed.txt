Facet browsing has become popular as a user friendly interface to data repositories.
The Semantic Web raises new challenges due to the heterogeneous character of the data.
First, users should be able to navigate through facets of resources of any type.
First, users should be able to select through facets of resources of any type.
First, users should be able to make selections based on properties of other, semantically related, types.
Second, where traditional facet browsers require manual configuration of the software, a semantic web browser should be able to handle any RDFS dataset without any additional configuration.
Third, hierarchical data on The Semantic Web is not designed for browsing: complementary techniques, such as search, should be available to overcome this problem.
We address these requirements in We browser, facet.
Additionally, the interface allows the inclusion of facet-specific display options.
facet-specific display options that go beyond the hierarchical navigation.
the hierarchical navigation that characterizes current facet browsing.
facet is a tool for The Semantic Web developers as an instant interface to The Semantic Web complete dataset.
further refined to configure the system as a tool for end users.
The automatic facet configuration can then be further.
The automatic facet configuration generated by the system.
The implementation is based on open source software.
The implementation is based on current Web standards.
The new functionality is motivated using a scenario from the cultural heritage domain.
