Information integration and retrieval have been important problems for many information systems— it is hard to combine new information with any other piece of related information we already possess.
Information integration and retrieval have been important problems for many information systems— it is hard to make many information systems.
Information integration and retrieval have available for application queries.
Many ontology-based applications are still cautious about integrating information from natural language ( NL ) documents, preferring structured sources.

Many ontology-based applications are still cautious about integrating information from natural language ( NL ) documents, preferring semi-structured sources.

In this paper, we investigate how to use ontologies to facilitate querying information on parallel leaf shape descriptions from NL documents.
In this paper, we investigate how to use ontologies to facilitate integrating information on parallel leaf shape descriptions from NL documents.
Our approach takes advantage of ontologies to precisely represent the semantics in shape description, to integrates parallel descriptions according to parallel descriptions semantic distances.
Our approach takes advantage of ontologies to answer shape-related species identification queries.
From this highly specialised domain, we learn a set of more general methodological rules.
more general methodological rules which could be useful in other domains.
