A common approach for reasoning is to compute the deductive closure of an ontology.
A common approach for reasoning is to work on the closure at query time.
an ontology using the rules.
the rules specified.
A common approach for reasoning increases the space requirements.
A common approach for reasoning reduces the run time complexity.
The main reason of this increase is the subclass statements in the ontology.
The main reason of this increase is the type statements in the ontology.
Type statements show a significant percentage in most ontologies.
Since subclass is a transitive property, derivation of other statements, in particular type statements gives rise to an excess of inferred type statements.
Since subclass is a transitive property, derivation of other statements, in particular type statements gives rise to cyclic repetition.
particular type statements relying on this increase.
In brief, a major part of closure computation is deriving the type statements.
the type statements relying on subclass statements.
a syntactic transformation that is based on novel individual grouping constructs.
In this paper, we propose a syntactic transformation.
a syntactic transformation reduces the number of inferred type statements.
inferred type statements relying on subclass relations.
a syntactic transformation that is based on novel individual grouping constructs.
Thus, the space requirement of reasoning is reduced without affecting the soundness.
Thus, the space requirement of reasoning is reduced without affecting the completeness.
