The major difference between the two approaches is on the usage of “ foreign terms ” on the local model disjointness at the semantic level.

the domain disjointness assumption adopted by the linking approach.
We investigation shows that the domain disjointness assumption leads to several semantic difficulties.
these difficulties using the importing approach to linking ontology modules.
We explore the possibility of avoiding some of these difficulties.
