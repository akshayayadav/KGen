In recent years several measures for the gold standard based evaluation of ontology learning were proposed. They can be distinguished by the layers of an ontology (e.g. lexical term layer and concept hierarchy) they evaluate. Judging those measures with a list of criteria we show that there exist some measures sufficient for evaluating the lexical term layer. However, existing measures for the evaluation of concept hierarchies fail to meet basic criteria. This paper presents a new taxonomic measure which overcomes the problems of current approaches.
