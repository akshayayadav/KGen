We survey nearly 1300 OWL ontologies and RDFS schemas. The collection of statistical data allows us to perform analysis and report some trends. Though most of the documents are syntactically OWL Full, very few stay in OWL Full when they are syntactically patched by adding type triples. We also report the frequency of occurrences of OWL language constructs and the shape of class hierarchies in the ontologies. Finally, we note that of the largest ontologies surveyed here, most do not exceed the description logic expressivity of ALC.
