We survey RDFS schemas.
We survey nearly 1300 OWL ontologies.
The collection of statistical data allows us to report some trends.
The collection of statistical data allows us to perform analysis.
Though most of the documents are syntactically OWL Full Full, very few stay in OWL Full when most of the documents are syntactically patched by adding type triples.
We also report the frequency of occurrences of OWL language constructs.
We also report the frequency of the shape of class hierarchies in the ontologies.
the largest ontologies surveyed here.
Finally, We note that of the largest ontologies most do not exceed the description logic expressivity of ALC.
