Ontology mapping plays an important role in bridging the semantic gap between heterogeneous data sources.
Ontology mapping plays an important role in bridging the semantic gap between distributed data sources.
As the Semantic Web slowly becomes the amount of online semantic data increases, a new generation of tools is developed that automatically integrate this data.
As the Semantic Web slowly becomes the amount of online semantic data increases, a new generation of tools is developed that automatically find this data.

techniques that can be performed at run time.
Unlike in the case of these new tools, these new tools require mapping techniques.
The contribution of this paper is twofold.
First, we investigate the general requirements for run time.
run time mapping techniques.
an ontology based question answering tool.
algorithm that was designed to be used at run-time by an ontology.
Second, we describe we PowerMap mapping algorithm.
