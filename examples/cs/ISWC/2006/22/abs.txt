We explore flexible querying of RDF data, with the aim of making it possible to return data satisfying query conditions with varying degrees of exactness, and also to rank the results of a query depending on how “closely” they satisfy the query conditions. We make queries more flexible by logical relaxation of their conditions based on RDFS entailment and RDFS ontologies. We develop a notion of ranking of query answers, and present a query processing algorithm for incrementally computing the relaxed answer of a query. Our approach has application in scenarios where there is a lack of understanding of the ontology underlying the data, or where the data objects have heterogeneous sets of properties or irregular structures.
