We explore flexible querying of RDF data, with the aim of making it possible to return data.
We explore flexible querying of RDF data, with the aim of making it possible to rank the results of a query depending on how “ closely ” a query satisfy the query conditions.
data satisfying query conditions with varying degrees of exactness.
We make queries more flexible by logical relaxation of a query conditions based on RDFS ontologies.
We make queries more flexible by logical relaxation of a query conditions based on RDFS entailment.
We present a query processing algorithm for incrementally computing the relaxed answer of a query.
We develop a notion of ranking of query answers.
We approach where the data objects have heterogeneous sets of irregular structures.
We approach has application in scenarios.
scenarios where there is a lack of understanding of the ontology.
the ontology underlying the data.
We approach where the data objects have heterogeneous sets of properties.
