“ document-driven ” systems that individually process a small set of documents.
To date, such research has focused on “ document-driven ” systems.
a small set of documents annotating each with respect to a given ontology.
This paper introduces OntoSyphon.
an alternative that strives to more fully leverage.
more fully leverage existing ontological content while scaling to extract comparatively shallow content from millions of documents.
This paper introduces an alternative.
OntoSyphon operates in an “ ontology-driven ” manner: taking any ontology as input, OntoSyphon uses the ontology to specify web searches.
web searches that identify taxonomic information.
web searches that identify relations.
web searches that identify possible semantic instances.
Redundancy in The Semantic Web's, together with information from the ontology, is then used to automatically verify these candidate instances and relations, enabling OntoSyphon to operate in a fully automated, unsupervised manner.
we present experimental results.
A prototype of OntoSyphon is fully implemented.
experimental results that demonstrate substantial instance learning in a variety of domains based on independently constructed ontologies.
We also introduce new methods for improving instance verification.
We also demonstrate that new methods improve upon previously known techniques.
