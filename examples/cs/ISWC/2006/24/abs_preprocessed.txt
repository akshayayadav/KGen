Reasoning on OWL ontologies is known to be intractable in the worst-case because numerous assertions about individuals relations.
Reasoning on OWL ontologies is known to be intractable in the worst-case because numerous assertions about individuals relations.
the worst-case which is a serious problem.
Reasoning on OWL ontologies is known to be intractable in the worst-case because in practice, most OWL ontologies have large Aboxes.
a technique that uses a summary of the ontology ) to reduce reasoning to a small subset of the original Abox.
a technique that prove that We techniques are complete.
a technique that uses a summary of summary Abox ) to reduce reasoning to a small subset of the original Abox.
We propose a technique.
a technique that prove that We techniques are sound.
4 ontologies the largest of which has 6.5 million role assertions.
We demonstrate the scalability of this technique for consistency detection in 4 ontologies.
