Recently, the use of blogs has been a remarkable means to publish user interests.
In order to find suitable information resources from a large amount of blog entries we need an information filtering technique to automatically transcribe user interests to a user profile in detail.
blog entries which are published every day.
In this paper, we first classify user blog entries into service domain ontologies.
service domain ontologies that express a user’s interests semantically as a hierarchy of classes according to interest weight by a top-down approach.
In this paper, we first classify user blog entries into extract interest ontologies.
extract interest ontologies that express a user’s interests semantically as a hierarchy of classes according to interest weight by a top-down approach.
Next, with a bottom-up approach, users modify users interest ontologies to update users interests in more detail.
the interest weight assigned to each class and instance.
Furthermore, we propose a similarity measurement between ontologies.
ontologies considering the interest weight.
Then, we detect innovative blog entries.
the past based on the analysis of approximated ontologies of a user’s interests.
innovative blog entries that include concepts that the user has not thought about in the past.
experimental results that demonstrate the performance of We proposed methods using a large-scale blog entries.

We present experimental results.
