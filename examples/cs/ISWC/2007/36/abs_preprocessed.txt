the complete ontology-lifecycle— that is intended to support software engineers in designing ontology-based applications.
In this paper, we present an architecture for ontology-based applications— covering the complete ontology-lifecycle—.

we illustrate the use of the architecture in a concrete case study.
a concrete case study using the NeOn toolkit as one implementation of the architecture.
