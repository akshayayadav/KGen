We study the continuous evaluation of conjunctive triple pattern queries over RDF data stored in distributed hash tables.
In a continuous query scenario network nodes subscribe with long-standing queries.
RDF triples satisfying long-standing queries queries.
In a continuous query scenario network nodes receive answers whenever RDF triples are published.
We analyze two novel query processing algorithms for this scenario properties formally.
We present two novel query processing algorithms for this scenario.
We performance goal is to incur as little network traffic as possible.
We performance goal is to distribute query processing load evenly.
We performance goal is to distribute the storage evenly.
algorithms that scale to large amounts of RDF data.
We performance goal is to have algorithms.
the various performance tradeoffs that occur through a detailed experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms.
We discuss the various performance tradeoffs.
