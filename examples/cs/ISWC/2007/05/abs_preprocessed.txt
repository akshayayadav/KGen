widely-used software engineering abstractions which define guidelines for modeling common application scenarios.
Design patterns are widely-used software engineering abstractions.
Ontology design patterns are the extension of software patterns for knowledge acquisition in the Semantic Web.
In this work we present a design pattern for representing relevance depending on context in OWL ontologies, i.e. to assert which knowledge from the domain ought to be considered in a given scenario.
Besides the formal semantics we describe a reasoning procedure to extract relevant knowledge in the resulting ontology.
Besides the features of the pattern we describe a reasoning procedure to extract relevant knowledge in a plug-in for Protégé pattern use.
