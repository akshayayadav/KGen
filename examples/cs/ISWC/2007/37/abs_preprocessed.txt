Current information retrieval approaches do not formally capture the explicit meaning of a keyword query.
Current information retrieval approaches provide a comfortable way for the user to specify information needs on the basis of keywords.
Ontology-based approaches allow for sophisticated semantic search.
Ontology-based approaches impose a query syntax more difficult to handle.
In this paper, we present an approach for translating keyword queries to DL conjunctive queries using background knowledge available in ontologies.
an implementation which shows that this interpretation of keywords can then be used for both exploration of for a semantics-based declarative query answering process.
We present an implementation.
an implementation which shows that this interpretation of keywords can then be used for both exploration of asserted knowledge.
We also present an evaluation of a discussion of the limitations of the approach with respect to We underlying assumptions.

We also present an evaluation of We system to We underlying assumptions.
