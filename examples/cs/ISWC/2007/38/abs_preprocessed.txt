In this paper we describe a methodology for efficient synchronization.
merging of RDF models.
In this paper we describe RDFSync.
RDFSync is based on decomposing a model into Minimum Self-Contained graphs.
After illustrating theory we show how a RDF model can be represented by a list of hashes of such information fragments.
After deriving properties of Minimum Self-Contained graphs we show how a RDF model can be represented by a list of hashes of such information fragments.
The synchronization procedure here described is based on the evaluation comparison of these.
The synchronization procedure here described is based on the remote comparison of these.
these ordered lists.
Experimental results show that The synchronization procedure here described provides very significant savings on network traffic compared to the fileoriented synchronization of serialized RDF graphs.
Finally, we report the implementation of a protocol for executing The synchronization procedure here described over HTTP.
Finally, we provide the design.
