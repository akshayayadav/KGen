The development of ontologies involves continuous modifications.
The development of ontologies involves relatively small modifications.
Existing ontology reasoners, however, do not take advantage of the similarities between different versions of an ontology.
information obtained from previous versions of an ontology— based on the notion of a module.
incremental reasoning— that is, reasoning.
reasoning that reuses information.
In this paper, we propose a technique for incremental reasoning—.
we technique does not depend on a particular reasoning calculus.
we technique does not depend can be used in combination with any reasoner.
we have applied we results to incremental classification of OWL DL ontologies.
we have applied we found significant improvement over regular classification time on a set of real-world ontologies.
