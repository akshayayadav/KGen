The idea is to make the knowledge.
the knowledge embedded in the schema structures explicit by transforming the schemas into a shared, event-based representation of knowledge about the real world.
the knowledge embedded in the schema structures interoperable by transforming the schemas into a shared, event-based representation of knowledge about the real world.
