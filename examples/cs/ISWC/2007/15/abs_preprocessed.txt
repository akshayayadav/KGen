We present the architecture of an end-to-end semantic search engine.
an end-to-end semantic search engine that uses a graph data model to enable interactive query answering over structured data.
an end-to-end semantic search engine that uses a graph data model to enable interactive query answering over interlinked data.
structured data collected from many disparate sources on the Web.
interlinked data collected from many disparate sources on the Web.
In particular, we study distributed indexing methods for graph-structured data.
In particular, we study parallel query evaluation methods on a cluster of computers.
provide scale-up experiments on 7 billion synthetically generated statements.
we evaluate the system on a dataset with 430 million statements.
