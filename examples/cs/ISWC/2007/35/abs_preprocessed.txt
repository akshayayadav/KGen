many of these ontologies contain overlapping information.
In different areas these ontologies have been developed.
Often we would therefore want to be able to use multiple ontologies.
To obtain good results, we need to find the relationships between terms in the different ontologies.
Currently, there already exist a number of different alignment strategies.
a user that needs to align two ontologies to determine which of the different available strategies are the most suitable.
However, it is usually difficult for a user.
a method that provides recommendations on alignment strategies for a given alignment problem.
In this paper we propose a method.
a method uses the evaluation of the different available alignment strategies results to provide recommendations.
a method that provides recommendations on alignment strategies for a given alignment problem.
a method is based on the evaluation of the different available alignment strategies on several small selected pieces from the ontologies.
In this paper we give the basic steps of a method.
a method that provides recommendations on alignment strategies for a given alignment problem.
a method that provides recommendations on alignment strategies for a given alignment problem in the setting of an alignment problem with two well-known biomedical ontologies.

We also experiment with different implementations of the steps in a method.
