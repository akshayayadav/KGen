This research explores three SPARQL-based techniques to solve Semantic Web tasks.
Semantic Web tasks that often require similarity measures, such as ontology mapping.
Semantic Web tasks that often require similarity measures, such as semantic data integration.
Semantic Web tasks that often require similarity measures, such as Semantic Web service matchmaking.
Our aim is to see how far it is possible to integrate customized similarity functions into SPARQL to achieve good results for these tasks.
Our first approach exploits virtual triples calling property functions to establish virtual relations among resources under comparison.
resources that do not meet the requested similarity criteria.
Our first approach exploits virtual triples the second approach uses extension functions to filter out resources finally, Our third technique applies new solution modifiers to post-process a SPARQL solution sequence.
The semantics of the three approaches are formally elaborated.
The semantics of the three approaches are formally discussed.
Our close the paper with a demonstration of the usefulness of Our iSPARQL framework in the context of a data integration experiment.
