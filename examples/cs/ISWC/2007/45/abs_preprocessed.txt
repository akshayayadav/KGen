the differences that exist between two RDF models.
The ability to compute the differences is an important step to cope with the evolving nature of the Semantic Web.
In particular, RDF Deltas can be employed to reduce the amount of data advanced versioning services.
data that need to build.
In particular, RDF Deltas can be employed to reduce the amount of data advanced the Semantic Web synchronization.
data that need to be exchanged over the network.
data that need to be managed over the network.
formally analyze the underlying change operations possible combinations in terms of correctness, minimality, semantic identity.
in this paper we study various RDF comparison functions in conjunction with the semantics of the underlying change operations.
formally analyze the underlying change operations possible combinations in terms of redundancy properties.
By considering Deltas as sets of change operations.
