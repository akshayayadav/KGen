The ability to compute the differences that exist between two RDF models is an important step to cope with the evolving nature of the Semantic Web (SW). In particular, RDF Deltas can be employed to reduce the amount of data that need to be exchanged and managed over the network and hence build advanced SW synchronization and versioning services. By considering Deltas as sets of change operations, in this paper we study various RDF comparison functions in conjunction with the semantics of the underlying change operations and formally analyze their possible combinations in terms of correctness, minimality, semantic identity and redundancy properties.
