This paper presents a tableau approach for determining description logics outside the scope of OWL DL1 .1.
This paper presents a tableau approach for determining description logics outside the scope of current state-of-the-art tableau-based description logic systems.
In particular, we define complete tableau calculus for the description logic ALBO.
In particular, we define a sound for the description logic ALBO.
In particular, we show that the description logic ALBO provides a basis for decision procedures for numerous other description logics with full role negation.
In particular, we show that the description logic ALBO provides a basis for decision procedures for this logic with full role negation.
the description logic ALBO is the extension of ALC with the Boolean role operators, inverse of domain restriction operators.
the description logic ALBO is the extension of ALC with the Boolean role operators, inverse of roles restriction operators.
the description logic ALBO includes full support for nominals.
the description logic ALBO is the extension of ALC with the Boolean role operators, inverse of range restriction operators.
the description logic ALBO is a very expressive description logic is NExpTime-complete.
a very expressive description logic which subsumes Boolean modal logic in the two-variable fragment of first-order logic and reasoning.
a very expressive description logic which subsumes the two-variable fragment of first-order logic and reasoning in the two-variable fragment of first-order logic and reasoning.
An important novelty is the use of a generic, unrestricted blocking rule as a replacement for standard loop checking mechanisms.
standard loop checking mechanisms implemented in description logic systems.
An implementation of our approach exists in the extscMetTeL system.
