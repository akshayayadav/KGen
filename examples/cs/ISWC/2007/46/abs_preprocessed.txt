As an extension to the Semantic Web, Semantic Web will not only contain structured data with machine understandable semantics.
As an extension to the Semantic Web, Semantic Web will not only contain textual information.
While structured queries can be used to find information more precisely on the Semantic Web, keyword searches are still needed to help exploit textual information.
It thus becomes very important that we can combine precise structured queries with imprecise keyword searches to have a hybrid query capability.
In addition, due to the huge volume of information on the Semantic Web, the hybrid query must be processed in a very scalable way.
a hybrid query capability that combines unary tree-shaped structured queries with keyword searches.
In this paper, we define such a hybrid query capability.
We show how existing information retrieval index structures and functions can be reused to index semantic web data.

the index structure using existing information retrieval engines in an scalable manner.
the index structure using existing information retrieval engines in an efficient manner.
We show how the hybrid query is evaluated on the index structure.
We implemented this existing information retrieval approach in an engine.
an engine called Semplore.
Comprehensive experiments on Semplore performance show that Semplore is a promising approach.
Semplore leads us to believe that it may be possible to evolve current web search engines to search the Semantic Web.
