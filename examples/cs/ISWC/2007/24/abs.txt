Recently the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) produced a standard set of “Semantic Annotations for WSDL and XML Schema” (SAWSDL). SAWSDL provides a standard means by which WSDL documents can be related to semantic descriptions, such as those provided by OWL-S (OWL for Services) and other Semantic Web services frameworks. We argue that the value of SAWSDL cannot be realized until its use is specified, and its benefits explained, in connection with a particular framework. This paper is an important first step toward meeting that need, with respect to OWL-S. We explain what OWL-S constructs are appropriate for use with the various SAWSDL annotations, and provide a rationale and guidelines for their use. In addition, we discuss some weaknesses of SAWSDL, and identify some ways in which OWL-S could evolve so as to integrate more smoothly with SAWSDL.
