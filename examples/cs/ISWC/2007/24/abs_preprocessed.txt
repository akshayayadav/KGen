Recently the World Wide Web Consortium produced a standard set of “ Semantic Annotations for WSDL ” ( SAWSDL ).
Recently the World Wide Web Consortium produced a standard set of “ Semantic Annotations for XML Schema ” ( SAWSDL ).
SAWSDL provides other Semantic Web services frameworks.
SAWSDL provides a standard means ( OWL for Services ).
those provided by OWL-S.
a standard means by which WSDL documents can be related to semantic descriptions, such as those.
We argue that the value of SAWSDL can not be realized until SAWSDL use is specified.
SAWSDL benefits explained, in connection with a particular framework.
meeting that need, with respect to OWL-S.
This paper is an important first step toward meeting.
We explain what OWL-S constructs are appropriate for use with the various SAWSDL annotations.
provide a rationale and guidelines for OWL-S constructs use.
In addition, We discuss some weaknesses of SAWSDL.
In addition, We identify some ways.
some ways in which OWL-S could evolve so as to integrate more smoothly with SAWSDL.
