Developers of Semantic Web applications face a challenge with respect to the decentralised publication model: where to find statements about encountered resources. The “linked data” approach, which mandates that resource URIs should be de-referenced and yield metadata about the resource, helps but is only a partial solution. We present Sindice, a lookup index over resources crawled on the Semantic Web. Our index allows applications to automatically retrieve sources with information about a given resource. In addition we allow resource retrieval through inverse-functional properties, offer full-text search and index SPARQL endpoints.
