In this paper we present a solution for “ weaving the claim web ”, i.e. the creation of knowledge networks via so-called claims.
so-called claims stated in scientific publications.
scientific publications created with the SALT ( Semantically Annotated ) framework.
To attain this objective, we evolved the appropriate ontologies.
To attain this objective, we defined reference mechanism.
To attain this objective, we provide support for claim identification.
To attain this objective, we defined a claim citation.
a prototypical claim search engine which allows to reference to existing claims and hence, weave the web.
We also describe a prototypical claim search engine.
Finally, We performed a small-scale evaluation of the SALT -LRB- Semantically Annotated -RRB- framework with a quite promising outcome.
