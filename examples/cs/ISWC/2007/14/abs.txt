In this paper we present a solution for “weaving the claim web”, i.e. the creation of knowledge networks via so-called claims stated in scientific publications created with the SALT (Semantically Annotated ) framework. To attain this objective, we provide support for claim identification, evolved the appropriate ontologies and defined a claim citation and reference mechanism. We also describe a prototypical claim search engine, which allows to reference to existing claims and hence, weave the web. Finally, we performed a small-scale evaluation of the authoring framework with a quite promising outcome.
