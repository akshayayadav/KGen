Natural language interfaces offer end-users a familiar and convenient option for querying ontology-based knowledge bases. Several studies have shown that they can achieve high retrieval performance as well as domain independence. This paper focuses on usability and investigates if NLIs are useful from an end-userâ€™s point of view. To that end, we introduce four interfaces each allowing a different query language and present a usability study benchmarking these interfaces. The results of the study reveal a clear preference for full sentences as query language and confirm that NLIs are useful for querying Semantic Web data.
