The discovery of suitable Web services for a given task is one of the central operations in Service-oriented Architectures.
research on Semantic Web services aims at automating this step.
automated discovery based on semantic matchmaking.
semantic matchmaking become important.
For the large amount of available Web services that can be expected in the computational costs of automated discovery.
For the large amount of available Web services that can be expected in real-world settings.
To make a discovery engine a reliable software component, we must thus aim at minimizing both the mean of the duration of the discovery task.
To make a discovery engine a reliable software component, we must thus aim at minimizing both the variance of the duration of the discovery task.
environments that exploits structural knowledge results for reducing the search space of consequent discovery operations.
environments that exploits previous discovery results for reducing the search space of consequent discovery operations.
For this, we present an extension for discovery engines in Stanford research on Semantic Web services environments.
we prototype implementation shows significant improvements when applied to the Stanford research on Semantic Web services Challenge scenario and dataset.
