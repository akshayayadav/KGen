Ontologies play a core role in the success of the Semantic Web as the Semantic Web provide a shared vocabulary for different resources and applications.
Developing an error-free ontology is a difficult task.
A common kind of error for an ontology is logical contradiction or incoherence.
In this paper, we propose some approaches to measuring incoherence in DL-based ontologies.
These measures give an ontology engineer important information for evaluating ontologies.
These measures give an ontology engineer important information for maintaining ontologies.

We provide some preliminary but encouraging empirical results.
We implement the proposed approaches but encouraging empirical results.
