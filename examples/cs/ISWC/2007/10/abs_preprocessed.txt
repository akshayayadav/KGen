a given ontology which the software consults in order to interpret the inputâ€™s semantics.
The input sentences are analysed deterministically with respect to a given ontology this allows the user to learn fewer syntactic structures since some of fewer syntactic structures can be used to refer to either classes for example.

The input sentences are analysed compositionally with respect to a given ontology this allows the user to learn fewer syntactic structures since some of fewer syntactic structures can be used to refer to either classes for example.

A repeated-measures, task-based evaluation has been carried out in comparison with a well-known ontology editor; the software received favourable results for basic tasks.
This paper also discusses work in future plans for developing this language and tool.
