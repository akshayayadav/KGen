We describe the challenges and our approach, and present a prototype tool to help users identify reasoner performance bottlenecks with respect to their ontologies. We then describe 4 case studies on synthetic and real-world ontologies. While the anecdotal evidence suggests that the service can be useful for both ontology developers and reasoner implementors, much more is desired.
