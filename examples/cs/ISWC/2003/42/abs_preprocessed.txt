In the “ traditional approach ” to ontology engineering, experts add new data by carefully analyzing others’ ontologies into the existing hierarchy.

scratch that addresses ordinary users immediate needs, without worrying how ordinary users data may some day integrate with others’ data.
In the emerging “ Semantic Web approach ”, ordinary users may not look at anyone’s ontology before creating ordinary users– instead, ordinary users may simply define a new local schema from scratch.

This paper describes WebScripter .
This paper describes a tool for translating between the countless mini-ontologies that the `` Semantic Web approach ” yields.
In our approach, ordinary users graphically align data from multiple sources in a simple spreadsheet-like view without having to know anything about ontologies.
The resulting web of equivalency statements is then mined by WebScripter to help users find related ontologies and data.
The resulting web of equivalency statements is then mined by WebScripter to automatically align the related data with users own.
