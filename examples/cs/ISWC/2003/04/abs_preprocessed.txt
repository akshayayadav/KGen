Topic Maps are a standardized modelling approach for the semantic annotation and description of WWW resources.
Topic Maps enable navigational access on information objects.
information objects stored in semi-structured information spaces like the WWW.
Topic Maps enable an improved search on information objects.

The proposed TMUML meta model, directly derived from the well known UML meta model, is a meta model for Topic Maps.

We will examine show in several examples.
several examples how The proposed TMUML meta model, directly derived from the well known UML meta model, enables semantic constraints for Topic Map.
Topic Map merging to be formulated in OCL.
We will examine the XTM merging conditions in several examples.
Finally, We will show how the TM validation process includes We merging conditions.
Finally, We will show how checking if a Topic Map is well formed includes We merging conditions.
