Personalized access and content syndication involving diverse conceptual representations of information resources are two of the key challenges of real-scale Semantic Web (SW) applications, such as e-Commerce, e-Learning or e-Science portals. RDFS represents nowadays the core SW language for creating and exchanging resource descriptions worldwide. Unfortunately, full-fledged view definition languages for the RDFS data model are still missing. We propose RVL, a view definition language capable of creating not only virtual resource descriptions, but also virtual RDFS schemas from classes, properties, as well as, resource descriptions available on the Semantic Web. RVL exploits the functional nature and type system of the RQL query language in order to navigate, filter and restructure complex RDFS schema and resource description graphs.
