This paper describes the design and prototype implementation of a novel architecture for integrated concept, metadata and content based browsing and retrieval of museum information. The work is part of a European project involving several major galleries and the aim is to provide more versatile access to digital collections of museum artefacts, including 2-D images, 3-D models and other multimedia representations. An ontology for the museum domain, based on the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model, is being developed as a semantic layer with references to the digital collection as instance information. A graphical concept browser is an integral component in the user interface, allowing navigation through the semantic layer, display of thumbnails, or full representations of artefacts and textual information in appropriate viewers and the invocation of conventional content based searching or combined querying. Semantic Web technologies are used in system integration to describe how tools for analysis and visualisation can be applied to different data types and sources. This supports flexible and managed formulation, execution and interpretation of the results of distributed multimedia queries. Combined searches using concepts, content and metadata can be initiated from a single user interface.
