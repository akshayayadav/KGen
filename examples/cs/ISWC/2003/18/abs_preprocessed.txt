This paper introduces the DAML-S Virtual Machine.
This paper introduces an embedded component.
an embedded component that uses the DAML-S Process Model to control the interaction between Web services.
the rules used by The the DAML-S Virtual Machine to the DAML-S Operational Semantics.
We provide a proof of the validity of the implementation of the DAML-S Virtual Machine by proving a mapping from the rules.
the time required by a query to Amazon.com's.
an empirical evaluation that shows that the overhead is only a small fraction of the time.
the overhead required by The the DAML-S Virtual Machine during the interaction with Amazon.com's.
Finally.
We provide an example of use of the the DAML-S Virtual Machine with a DAML-Sized version of Amazon.comâ€™s Web service.
We conclude with an empirical evaluation.
The the DAML-S Virtual Machine provides crucial evidence that DAML-S can be effectively used to manage the interaction between Web Services.
