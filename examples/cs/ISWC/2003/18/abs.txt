This paper introduces the DAML-S Virtual Machine (DS-VM): an embedded component that uses the DAML-S Process Model to control the interaction between Web services. We provide a proof of the validity of the implementation of the DAML-S Virtual Machine by proving a mapping from the rules used by the DS-VM to the DAML-S Operational Semantics. Finally, we provide an example of use of the DS-VM with a DAML-Sized version of Amazon.comâ€™s Web service, and we conclude with an empirical evaluation that shows that the overhead required by the DS-VM during the interaction with Amazon is only a small fraction of the time required by a query to Amazon. The DS-VM provides crucial evidence that DAML-S can be effectively used to manage the interaction between Web Services.
