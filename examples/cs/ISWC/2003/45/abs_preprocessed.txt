a fire-new infrastructure promises to support an intelligent information-processing platform for multi-agent system whose ultimate objective is to provide better services for end-users, for example, interoperable information query.

Semantic Web supports a fire-new infrastructure for solving the problem of semantic information interoperability.
Therefore, except agent-to-agent interaction in multi-agent system, there is human-to-agent interaction.
To unify the two kinds of interaction, this paper introduces Q language– a scenario description language for designing interaction among agents.

A Q-based architecture is presented as a system solution to semantic information interoperability on Semantic Web.
A Q-based architecture which integrates multi-agent query system.
A Q-based architecture which integrates ontology servers.
A Q-based architecture which integrates semantic information sources.
A Q-based architecture which integrates ontology-mapping servers.
Furthermore, we investigate domain ontology, ontology-mapping service.
Furthermore, we investigate key technologies of interoperability.
Furthermore, we investigate related multi-agent system.
Furthermore, we give an implementation to demonstrate how our architecture works.
