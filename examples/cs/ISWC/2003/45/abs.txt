Semantic Web supports a fire-new infrastructure for solving the problem of semantic information interoperability, and it promises to support an intelligent and automatic information-processing platform for multi-agent system whose ultimate objective is to provide better services for end-users, for example, interoperable information query. Therefore, except agent-to-agent interaction in multi-agent system, there is human-to-agent interaction. To unify the two kinds of interaction, this paper introduces Q language â€“ a scenario description language for designing interaction among agents and users. A Q-based architecture, which integrates ontology servers, ontology-mapping servers, semantic information sources, and multi-agent query system, is presented as a system solution to semantic information interoperability on Semantic Web. Furthermore, we investigate key technologies of interoperability: domain ontology, ontology-mapping service, and related multi-agent system, and give an implementation to demonstrate how our architecture works.
