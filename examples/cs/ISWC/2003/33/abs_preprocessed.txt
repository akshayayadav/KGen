Although RDFXML has been widely recognized as the standard vehicle for representing semantic information on the Web, an enormous amount of semantic data is still being encoded in HTML documents.
HTML documents that are designed primarily for human consumption.
HTML documents that are not directly amenable to machine processing.
This paper seeks to bridge this semantic gap by addressing the fundamental problem of automatically annotating HTML documents with semantic labels.
Exploiting a key observation that semantically related items exhibit consistency in presentation style we have developed a novel framework for automatically partitioning such documents into semantic structures.
Exploiting a key observation that semantically related items exhibit spatial locality in template-based content-rich HTML documents we have developed a novel framework for automatically partitioning such documents into semantic structures.
semantic analysis incorporating lexical databases such as WordNet.
semantic analysis incorporating domain ontologies.
we framework tightly couples structural analysis of documents with semantic analysis.
we present experimental evidence of the effectiveness of we techniques on a large collection of HTML documents from various news portals.
