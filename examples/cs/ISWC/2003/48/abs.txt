This paper describes FrameNet [9,1,3], an online lexical resource for English based on the principles of frame semantics [5,7,2]. We provide a data category specification for frame semantics and FrameNet annotations in an RDF-based language. More specifically, we provide an RDF markup for lexical units, defined as a relation between a lemma and a semantic frame, and frame-to-frame relations, namely Inheritance and Subframes. The paper includes simple examples of FrameNet annotated sentences in an XML/RDF format that references the project-specific data category specification.
