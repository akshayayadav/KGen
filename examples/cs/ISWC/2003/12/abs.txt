The DAML-S Process Model is designed to support the application of AI planning techniques to the automated composition of Web services. SHOP2 is an Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planner well-suited for working with the Process Model. We have proven the correspondence between the semantics of SHOP2 and the situation calculus semantics of the Process Model. We have also implemented a system which soundly and completely plans over sets of DAML-S descriptions using a SHOP2 planner, and then executes the resulting plans over the Web. We discuss the challenges and difficulties of using SHOP2 in the information-rich and human-oriented context of Web services.
