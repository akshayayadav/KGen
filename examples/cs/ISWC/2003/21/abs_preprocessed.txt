In the next generation of the Internet semantic annotations will enable software agents to extract.
In the next generation of the Internet semantic annotations will interpret web content more quickly than this paper is possible with current techniques.
web services that are represented in DAML-S.
The focus of this paper is to develop security annotations for web services.
web services that are used by agents.
several security-related ontologies that are designed to represent well-known security concepts.
We propose several security-related ontologies.
several security-related ontologies that are designed to represent well-known security concepts.
several security-related ontologies are used to describe the security requirements and capabilities of web services providers.
several security-related ontologies are requesting agents.
A reasoning engine determines whether web service have comparable security characteristics.
A reasoning engine determines whether agents have comparable security characteristics.
We prototypical implementation uses the Java Theorem Prover from Stanford for determining the degree to which the requirements and capabilities match based on our matching algorithm.
security brokering between agents.
security brokering between services.
The security reasoner is integrated with the Semantic Matchmaker from CMU giving The security reasoner the ability to provide security.
