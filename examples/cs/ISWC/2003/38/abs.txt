We present a benchmark that facilitates the evaluation of DAML+OIL repositories in a standard and systematic way. This benchmark is intended to evaluate the performance of DAML+OIL repositories with respect to extensional queries over a large data set that commits to a single realistic ontology. It consists of the ontology, customizable synthetic data, a set of test queries, and several performance metrics. Main features of the benchmark include a plausible ontology for the university domain, a repeatable data set that can be scaled to an arbitrary size, and an approach for measuring the degree to which a repository returns complete query answers. We also show a benchmark experiment for the evaluation of DLDB, a DAML+OIL repository that extends a relational database management system with description logic inference capabilities.
