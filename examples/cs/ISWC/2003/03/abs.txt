When providing reasoning services for ontology languages such as DAML+OIL and OWL, it is necessary for description logics to deal with “concrete” datatypes (strings, integers, etc.) as well as “abstract” concepts and relationships. In this paper, we present a new approach, the datatype group approach, to integrating DLs with multiple datatypes. We discuss the advantages of such approach over the existing ones and show how a tableaux algorithm for the description logic SHOQ( D  n ) can be modified in order to reason with datatype groups.
