When providing reasoning services for ontology languages such as DAMLOIL it is necessary for “ abstract ” concepts and relationships.
When providing reasoning services for ontology languages such as OWL it is necessary for description logics to deal with “ concrete ” datatypes ( strings, integers ).

When providing reasoning services for ontology languages such as DAMLOIL it is necessary for description logics to deal with “ concrete ” datatypes ( strings, integers ).
In this paper, we present a new approach, the datatype group approach, to integrating DLs with multiple datatypes.
we show how a tableaux algorithm for D n ) can be modified in order to reason with datatype groups.
we show how a tableaux algorithm for the description logic SHOQ ) can be modified in order to reason with datatype groups.
we discuss the advantages of such approach over the existing ones.
