Resources on the Semantic Web are described by metadata based on some formal ontology.
Resources on the Semantic Web are described by metadata based on some informal ontology.
It is a common situation that casual users are not familiar with a domain ontology in detail.
This makes This difficult for or This user tools ) to formulate queries to find the relevant resources.
This makes This difficult for such users ) to formulate queries to find the relevant resources.
Users consider the resources in Users specific context, so the most straightforward solution is to formulate queries in an ontology.
an ontology that corresponds to a user-specific view.
multiple views expressed in ontologies simpler than the domain ontology.
We present an approach based on multiple views.
This allows users to query heterogeneous data repositories in terms of multiple, relatively simple, view ontologies.
Ontology developers can define such view ontologies.
Ontology developers can define the corresponding mapping rules.
multiple, relatively simple, view ontologies are represented in the Semantic Web ontology languages such as OWL.
multiple, relatively simple, view ontologies are represented in the Semantic Web ontology languages such as RDFS.
multiple, relatively simple, view ontologies are represented in the Semantic Web ontology languages such as DAMLOIL.
We present We approach with examples from the e-learning domain.
the e-learning domain using the the Semantic Web query and transformation language TRIPLE.
