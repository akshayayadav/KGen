One of the challenging problems that Web service technology faces is the ability to effectively discover services based on Web service technology capabilities.
We present an approach to tackle this problem in the context of DAML-S ontologies of services.
The proposed approach enables to select the combinations of Web services that best match a given request effectively computes the extra information with respect to Q ( the information required by a service request ).
The proposed approach enables to select the combinations of Web services that best match a given request effectively computes the extra information with respect to Q ( the information not provided by any existing service ).
The proposed approach enables to select the combinations of Web services that best match a given request Q.
The proposed approach enables to select the combinations of Web services that best match a given request effectively computes the extra information with respect to Q ( e.g. ).
an algorithm derived from hypergraphs theory.
We study the reasoning problem.
We propose an algorithm.
the reasoning problem associated with such a matching process.
