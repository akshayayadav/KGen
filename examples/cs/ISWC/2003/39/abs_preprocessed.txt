We describe DAMLJessKB.
We describe performing inference on the Semantic Web.
We describe a tool for reasoning with the DARPA Agent Markup Language.
DAMLJessKB maps semantics from the DARPA Agent Markup Language into facts for use in a production system, such as the Java Expert System Shell.
DAMLJessKB maps semantics from the DARPA Agent Markup Language into rules for use in a production system, such as the Java Expert System Shell.
This article provides a detailed example of how DAMLJessKB can be used to make decisions about DAML-encoded engineering design knowledge.
This article presents our underlying methodology.
We believe that tools like DAMLJessKB are needed to help realize the full potential of the Semantic Web.
