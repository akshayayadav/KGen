We describe DAMLJessKB, a tool for reasoning with the DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) and performing inference on the Semantic Web. DAMLJessKB maps semantics from DAML into facts and rules for use in a production system, such as the Java Expert System Shell (JESS). This article presents our underlying methodology and provides a detailed example of how DAMLJessKB can be used to make decisions about DAML-encoded engineering design knowledge. We believe that tools like DAMLJessKB are needed to help realize the full potential of the Semantic Web and DAML.
