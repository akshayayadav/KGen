We develop a semantics based approach to process information on the semantic web.
We show how Horn logic can be used to denotationally capture the semantics of mark-up languages.
mark-up languages designed for describing resources on the semantic web ( such as RDF ).
The same approach can also be used to specify the semantics of query languages for the semantic web.
these executable semantics are executable.
when put together can be used to compute answers to semantic web queries.
The main advantage of this semantic-based approach to processing the semantic web is that these executable semantics can be developed extremely quickly.
Thus, as the semantic web mark-up languages evolve rapidly, the semantic web mark-up languages implementations can be developed at the same pace.
In this paper, we present we approach based on denotational semantics.
In this paper, we present we approach based on Horn logic.
our approach is applicable to XML, RDF, DAML ) though in this paper we illustrate this paper via RDF ).
our approach is applicable to any description format ) though in this paper we illustrate this paper via Resource Description Framework ).
our approach is quite general though in this paper we illustrate this paper via RDF ).
