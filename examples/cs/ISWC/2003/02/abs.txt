RDF Schema (RDFS) has a non-standard metamodeling architecture, which makes some elements in the model have dual roles in the RDFS specification. As a result, this can be confusing and difficult to understand and, more importantly, the specification of its semantics requires a non-standard model theory. This leads to semantic problems when trying to layer conventional first order languages, like DAML+OIL, on top of RDFS. In this paper we will first demonstrate how this problem with RDFS can be solved in a sub-language of RDFS â€“ RDFS(FA), which introduces a Fixed layer metamodeling Architecture to RDFS, based on a (relatively) standard model-theoretic semantics. Logical layer Semantic Web languages such as DAML+OIL and OWL can, therefore, be built on top of both the syntax and semantics of RDFS(FA). We will also compare this approach with the existing RDF Model Theory and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches.
