We study the problem of interoperability among XML data sources.
We propose a lightweight infrastructure for this purpose.
this purpose that derives a lightweight infrastructure for this purpose.
this purpose that derives its inspiration from the recent semantic web initiative inspiration from the recent semantic web initiative.
We approach is based on enriching local sources with semantic declarations so as to enable interoperability.
semantic declarations expose the semantics of the information content of sources by mapping the concepts present therein to a common ( application specific ) vocabulary, in the spirit of RDF.
tools that may assist in generating semantic declarations.
tools that may assist in generating formulation of global queries.
this purpose that derives its inspiration from the recent semantic web initiative.
tools that may address some interesting issues in query processing and optimization.
In addition to a lightweight infrastructure for this purpose We discuss tools.
