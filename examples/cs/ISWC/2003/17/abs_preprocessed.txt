Easy integration of available tools will be a key success factor for the future of the Semantic Web.
We envision that semantic descriptions of the tools the tools themselves will play an important part in addressing this issue.

This paper discusses the major problems that We encountered as well as suggested solutions.
the Semantic Web research groups who wish to use annotated tools.
the Semantic Web research groups who wish to annotate other Semantic Web research groups tools.
This work is relevant to other the Semantic Web research groups.
Also, We hope to offer helpful input to the DAML-S coalition in the further development of other Semantic Web research groups standard.
