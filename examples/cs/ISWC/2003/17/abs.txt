Easy integration of available tools will be a key success factor for the future of the Semantic Web. We envision that semantic descriptions of the tools themselves will play an important part in addressing this issue. Motivated by this vision we used DAML-S (a key initiative to support automated management of Web services) to describe Sesame (an RDF(S) storage and query engine). This paper discusses the major problems that we encountered as well as suggested solutions. This work is relevant to other Semantic Web research groups who wish to annotate their tools or to use annotated tools. Also, we hope to offer helpful input to the DAML-S coalition in the further development of their standard.
