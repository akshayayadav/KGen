The semantic web is a promising application-area for the Prolog programming language for its non-determinism and pattern-matching. In this paper we outline an infrastructure for loading and saving RDF/XML, storing triples, elementary reasoning with triples and visualization. A predecessor of the infrastructure described here has been used in various applications for ontology-based annotation of multimedia objects using semantic web languages. Our library aims at fast parsing, fast access and scalability for fairly large but not unbounded applications upto 40 million triples.
