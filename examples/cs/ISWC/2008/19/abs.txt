We analyze the datatype system of OWL and OWL 2, and discuss certain nontrivial consequences of its definition, such as the extensibility of the set of supported datatypes and complexity of reasoning. We also argue that certain datatypes from the list of normative datatypes in the current OWL 2 Working Draft are inappropriate and should be replaced with different ones. Finally, we present an algorithm for datatype reasoning. Our algorithm is modular in the sense that it can handle any datatype that supports certain basic operations. We show how to implement these operations for number and string datatypes.
