We analyze the datatype system of OWL.
We discuss certain nontrivial consequences of the datatype system of OWL such as the extensibility of the set of supported datatypes and complexity of reasoning.
We discuss certain nontrivial consequences of the datatype system of OWL 2 definition such as the extensibility of the set of supported datatypes and complexity of reasoning.
We analyze the datatype system of OWL 2.
We also argue that certain datatypes from the list of normative datatypes in the current OWL 2 should be replaced with different ones.
the current OWL 2 Working Draft.
We also argue that certain datatypes from the list of normative datatypes in the current OWL 2 are inappropriate.
Finally, We present an algorithm for datatype reasoning.
any datatype that supports certain basic operations.
an algorithm for datatype reasoning is modular in the sense that an algorithm for datatype reasoning can handle any datatype.
We show how to implement certain basic operations for string datatypes.
We show how to implement certain basic operations for number datatypes.
