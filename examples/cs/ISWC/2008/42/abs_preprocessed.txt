ontologies which considers especially the object properties between the concepts.
This paper presents a new semantic relatedness measure on ontologies.
Our approach relies on two hypotheses.
Firstly, using only object properties only a few paths can be considered as “ semantically corrects ” and these paths obey to a given set of rules.
Firstly, using only concept hierarchy only a few paths can be considered as “ semantically corrects ” and these paths obey to a given set of rules.
Secondly, following a given edge in a path has a cost ( represented as a weight ).
a cost ( represented as a weight ) which depends on a given edge in a path type ).
a cost ( represented as a weight ) which depends on a given edge in is-a, part-of ).
a cost ( represented as a weight ) which depends on a given edge in a path position in a path.
a cost ( represented as a weight ) which depends on a given edge in a path context in the ontology.
We propose an evaluation of We measure on the lexical base WordNet.
the lexical base WordNet using part-of relation with two different benchmarks.
We show that, in this context, our measure outperforms the classical semantic measures.
