The idea is to combine the TBox inferencing capabilities of the DL algorithms over large ABoxes.
The idea is to combine the scalability of the rule paradigm over large ABoxes.
Towards this end, we define The DLE framework.
The DLE framework enhances the entailment-based OWL reasoning paradigm in two directions.
Firstly, The DLE framework disengages the manipulation of the TBox semantics from any incomplete entailment-based approach, using the efficient DL algorithms.
Secondly, The DLE framework achieves faster application of the ABox-related entailments comparing The DLE framework to the conventional entailment-based approaches, due to the low complexity.
Secondly, The DLE framework achieves faster application of efficient memory usage comparing The DLE framework to the conventional entailment-based approaches, due to the low complexity.
Secondly, The DLE framework achieves faster application of efficient memory usage comparing The DLE framework to the conventional entailment-based approaches, due to the domain-specific nature of the entailments.
