parametric language-independent kernel functions defined for individuals within ontologies.
A novel family of parametric language-independent kernel functions is presented.
linear classifiers that offer an alternative way to perform classification w.r.t. deductive reasoning.
individuals within ontologies are easily integrated with efficient statistical learning methods for inducing linear classifiers.
A method for adapting the parameters of the kernel to the knowledge base through stochastic optimization is also proposed.
tasks where an inductive approach may bridge the gaps of the standard methods due the inherent incompleteness of the knowledge bases.
This enables the exploitation of statistical learning in a variety of tasks.
real ontologies collected from standard repositories.
approximate query answering with real ontologies.
In this work, a system has been tested in experiments on approximate query.
a system integrating the kernels.
