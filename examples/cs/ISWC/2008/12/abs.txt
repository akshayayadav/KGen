A novel family of parametric language-independent kernel functions defined for individuals within ontologies is presented. They are easily integrated with efficient statistical learning methods for inducing linear classifiers that offer an alternative way to perform classification w.r.t. deductive reasoning. A method for adapting the parameters of the kernel to the knowledge base through stochastic optimization is also proposed. This enables the exploitation of statistical learning in a variety of tasks where an inductive approach may bridge the gaps of the standard methods due the inherent incompleteness of the knowledge bases. In this work, a system integrating the kernels has been tested in experiments on approximate query answering with real ontologies collected from standard repositories.
