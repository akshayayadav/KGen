A large amount of terms ) have been published on the Semantic Web by various parties, to be shared for describing resources.
a directed dependence relation is formed.
Terms are defined based on other terms.
The study of term dependence is important for many other tasks, such as ontology maintenance.
The study of term dependence is a foundation work.
The study of term dependence is important for many other tasks, such as integration.
The study of term dependence is important for many other tasks, such as distributed reasoning on the Web scale.
In this paper, we analyze the complex network characteristics of the term dependence graph.
In this paper, we analyze the complex network characteristics of the induced vocabulary dependence graph.
The graphs are constructed from a large data set that contains 1,278,233 terms in 3,039 vocabularies.
The graphs analyzed in the experiments.
The results characterize reachability.
The results characterize degree distributions.
The results characterize connectivity.
The results characterize the current status.
