For easing the exchange of news, the International Press Telecommunication Council (IPTC) has developed the NewsML Architecture (NAR), an XML-based model that is specialized into a number of languages such as NewsML G2 and EventsML G2. As part of this architecture, specific controlled vocabularies, such as the IPTC News Codes, are used to categorize news items together with other industry-standard thesauri. While news is still mainly in the form of text-based stories, these are often illustrated with graphics, images and videos. Media-specific metadata formats, such as EXIF, DIG35 and XMP, are used to describe the media. The use of different metadata formats in a single production process leads to interoperability problems within the news production chain itself. It also excludes linking to existing web knowledge resources and impedes the construction of uniform end-user interfaces for searching and browsing news content.
