We describe RDF123 for translating spreadsheet data to RDF.
We describe a highly flexible open-source tool for translating spreadsheet data to RDF.
each column representing a property.
Existing spreadsheet-to-rdf tools typically map only to star-shaped RDF graphs, i.e. each spreadsheet row is an instance, with each column.
RDF123, on the other hand, allows users to define mappings to arbitrary graphs, thus allowing much richer spreadsheet semantics to be expressed.
Further, each row in the spreadsheet can be mapped with a fairly different RDF scheme.
Two interfaces are available.
users mapping in an intuitive manner.
a graphical application that allows users to create users.
The first is a graphical application.
a Web service that takes as input a URL to CSV file map.
a Web service that provides RDF as output.
a Web service that takes as input a URL to a Google spreadsheet map.
The second is a Web service.
a Web service that takes as input a URL to an RDF123 map.
