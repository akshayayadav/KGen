We describe RDF123, a highly flexible open-source tool for translating spreadsheet data to RDF. Existing spreadsheet-to-rdf tools typically map only to star-shaped RDF graphs, i.e. each spreadsheet row is an instance, with each column representing a property. RDF123, on the other hand, allows users to define mappings to arbitrary graphs, thus allowing much richer spreadsheet semantics to be expressed. Further, each row in the spreadsheet can be mapped with a fairly different RDF scheme. Two interfaces are available. The first is a graphical application that allows users to create their mapping in an intuitive manner. The second is a Web service that takes as input a URL to a Google spreadsheet or CSV file and an RDF123 map, and provides RDF as output.
