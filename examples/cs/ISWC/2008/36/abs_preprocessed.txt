scalable discovery mechanisms are critical for enabling service-oriented architectures on the Semantic Web.
Efficient discovery mechanisms are critical for enabling service-oriented architectures on the Semantic Web.
The majority of currently existing approaches focuses on deals with efficiency typically by pre-computing concepts.
The majority of currently existing approaches focuses on centralized architectures typically by pre-computing concepts.
The majority of currently existing approaches focuses on centralized architectures typically by storing the results of the semantic matcher for all possible query concepts.

Such approaches, however, fail to scale with respect to the size of the ontologies.

Such approaches, however, fail to scale with respect to the number of service advertisements.
the Semantic Web service discovery that is suitable for both P2P environments.
On the other hand, this paper presents an scalable index-based method for the Semantic Web service discovery.
On the other hand, this paper presents an efficient index-based method for the Semantic Web service discovery.
the Semantic Web service discovery that is suitable for both centralized environments.
the Semantic Web service discovery that allows for fast selection of services at query time.
We employ a novel encoding of the service descriptions, allowing the match between a request and an advertisement to be evaluated in constant time, and we index these representations to prune the search space, reducing the number of comparisons.
comparisons required.
further reducing the search engineâ€™s response time.
Given a desired ranking function, the search algorithm can retrieve the top-k matches progressively.
better matches are returned first, thereby further.
better matches are computed first, thereby further.
we also show how the search engine's can be performed efficiently in a suitable structured P2P overlay network.
The benefits of the proposed method are demonstrated through experimental evaluation on both synthetic data.
