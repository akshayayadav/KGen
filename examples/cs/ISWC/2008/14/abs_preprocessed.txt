Human-defined concepts are fundamental building-blocks in constructing knowledge bases such as ontologies.
Statistical learning techniques provide an alternative automated approach to concept definition.
concept definition driven by data.
concept definition driven by prior knowledge.
In this paper we propose a probabilistic modeling framework.
a probabilistic modeling framework that combines both data-driven topics in a principled manner.
a probabilistic modeling framework that combines both human-defined concepts in a principled manner.
The methodology we propose is based on applications of statistical topic models ( also known as latent Dirichlet allocation models ).
We demonstrate the utility of this general framework in two ways.
We first illustrate how The methodology we propose can be used to automatically tag Web pages with concepts from a known set of concepts without any need for labeled documents.
We then perform a series of experiments.
experiments that quantify how combining human-defined semantic knowledge with data-driven techniques leads to better language models than can be obtained with either alone.
