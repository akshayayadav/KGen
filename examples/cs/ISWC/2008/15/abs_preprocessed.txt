There are many reasons for measuring a distance between ontologies.
In particular, it is useful to know quickly if two ontologies are close or remote before determining to match two ontologies.
To that extent, a distance between ontologies must be quickly computable.
constraints applying to several possible ontology distances.
constraints applying to such measures.
We present constraints.
Then We evaluate experimentally some of several possible ontology distances in order to assess some of speed.
Then We evaluate experimentally some of such measures in order to assess some of them accuracy.
