novel techniques which allow for efficient querying of large expressive knowledge bases in secondary storage.
Grounded conjunctive query answering over OWL-DL ontologies is intractable in the worst case.
we present novel techniques.
In particular, we show that we can effectively answer grounded conjunctive queries without building a full completion forest for a large Abox ( unlike state of the art tableau reasoners ).
Instead we rely on the completion forest of a dramatically reduced summary of a large Abox.
we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in Aboxes with up to 45 million assertions.
