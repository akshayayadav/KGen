This paper studies the expressive power of SPARQL. The main result is that SPARQL and non-recursive safe Datalog with negation have equivalent expressive power, and hence, by classical results, SPARQL is equivalent from an expressiveness point of view to Relational Algebra. We present explicit generic rules of the transformations in both directions. Among other findings of the paper are the proof that negation can be simulated in SPARQL, that non-safe filters are superfluous, and that current SPARQL W3C semantics can be simplified to a standard compositional one.
