This paper studies the expressive power of SPARQL.
hence, by classical results, SPARQL is equivalent from an expressiveness point of view to Relational Algebra.
The main result is that SPARQL have equivalent expressive power.
The main result is that non-recursive safe Datalog with negation have equivalent expressive power.
We present explicit generic rules of the transformations in both directions.
Among other findings of This paper are the proof that negation can be simulated in SPARQL, that non-safe filters are superfluous.
Among other findings of This paper are the proof that current SPARQL W3C semantics can be simplified to a standard compositional one.
