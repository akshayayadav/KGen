We propose a novel method for reasoning in the description logic SHIQ.
an ordered binary decision diagram which represents a canonical model for T.
a satisfiability preserving transformation from SHIQ to the description logic ALCIb, the obtained ALCIb Tbox T.
After a satisfiability is converted into an ordered binary decision diagram.
a disjunctive datalog program that can be used for Abox reasoning.
This an ordered binary decision diagram.
This an is turned into a disjunctive datalog program.
The algorithm is worst-case optimal w.r.t. data complexity.
The algorithm admits easy extensions with DL-safe rules.
The algorithm admits easy extensions with ground conjunctive queries.
