Controlled Language (CL) for Ontology Editing tools offer an attractive alternative for naive users wishing to create ontologies, but they are still required to spend time learning the correct syntactic structures and vocabulary in order to use the Controlled Language properly. This paper extends previous work (CLOnE) which uses standard NLP tools to process the language and manipulate an ontology. Here we also generate text in the CL from an existing ontology using template-based (or shallow) Natural Language Generation (NLG). The text generator and the CLOnE authoring process combine to form a RoundTrip Ontology Authoring environment: one can start with an existing imported ontology or one originally produced using CLOnE, (re)produce the Controlled Language, modify or edit the text as required and then turn the text back into the ontology in the CLOnE environment. Building on previous methodology we undertook an evaluation, comparing the RoundTrip Ontology Authoring process with a well-known ontology editor; where previous work required a CL reference manual with several examples in order to use the controlled language, the use of NLG reduces this learning curve for users and improves on existing results for basic ontology editing tasks.
