vocabularies originating from keywords.
keywords assigned in a more traditional way.
web based systems.
vocabularies originating from often called folksonomies.
systems in which users can annotate items.
vocabularies originating from collaborative annotation processes.
The emergence of web raises the question of the semantic interoperability between vocabularies.
instance based mapping between the vocabularies.
If collections are annotated according to two systems, e.g. with keywords the annotated data can be used for instance.
If collections are annotated according to two systems, e.g. with tags the annotated data can be used for instance.
The basis for this kind of matching is an appropriate similarity measure between concepts.
concepts based on this kind of matching distribution as annotations.
In this paper we propose a new similarity measure generated metadata.
a new similarity measure that can take advantage of some special properties of user.
Wikipedia which are both annotated by users of the bookmarking service del.icio.us.
a new similarity measure that can take advantage of some special properties of user with a set of articles from Wikipedia.
we have evaluated a new similarity measure.
Wikipedia which are both classified according to the topic structure of Wikipedia.
The results using a new similarity measure.
The results are significantly better than those.
standard similarity measures proposed for this task in the literature.
a new similarity measure that can take advantage of some special properties of user.
this task in the literature correlates better with human judgments.
those obtained using standard similarity measures.
We argue that a new similarity measure also has benefits for instance.
instance based mapping of more traditionally developed vocabularies.
a new similarity measure that can take advantage of some special properties of user.
