In this paper, we present a framework for developing ontologies in a modular manner, which is based on the notions of interfaces and knowledge encapsulation. Within the context of this framework, an ontology can be defined and developed as a set of ontology modules that can access the knowledge bases of the others through their well-defined interfaces. An important implication of the proposed framework is that ontology modules can be developed completely independent of each othersâ€™ signature and language. Such modules are free to only utilize the required knowledge segments of the others. We describe the interface-based modular ontology formalism, which theoretically supports this framework and present its distinctive features compared to the exiting modular ontology formalisms. We also describe the real-world design and implementation of the framework for creating modular ontologies by extending OWL-DL and modifying the Swoop interfaces and reasoners.
