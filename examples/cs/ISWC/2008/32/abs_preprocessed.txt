In this paper, we present the proposed framework.
ontology modules that can access the knowledge bases of the others through the knowledge bases of the others.
Within the context of the proposed framework, an ontology can be defined and developed as a set of ontology modules well-defined interfaces.
An important implication of the proposed framework is that ontology modules can be developed completely independent of each othersâ€™ signature and language.
Such modules are free to only utilize the required knowledge segments of the others.
the interface-based modular ontology formalism which theoretically present the proposed framework.
the interface-based modular ontology formalism which theoretically supports the proposed framework.
We describe the interface-based modular ontology formalism distinctive features compared to the exiting modular ontology formalisms.
We also describe the real-world design and implementation of the proposed framework for modifying the Swoop interfaces and reasoners.
We also describe the real-world design and implementation of the proposed framework for creating modular ontologies by extending OWL-DL.
