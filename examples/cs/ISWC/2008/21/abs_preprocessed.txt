Finding mappings between compatible ontologies is an important open problem.
Finding mappings between compatible ontologies is an difficult open problem.
Instance-based methods for solving this problem reflect concept semantics as the most active parts of the ontologies are actually being used.
Instance-based methods for solving this problem have the advantage of focusing on the most active parts of the ontologies.
However such methods have not at present been widely investigated in ontology mapping, compared to linguistic techniques.
However such methods have not at present been widely investigated in ontology mapping, compared to structural techniques.
Furthermore, previous instance-based mapping techniques were only applicable to cases with.
cases where a substantial set of instances was available that was doubly annotated.
Furthermore, previous instance-based mapping techniques were only applicable to cases vocabularies.
In this paper we approach the mapping problem as a classification problem based on the similarity between instances of concepts.
This has the advantage that no doubly annotated instances are required, so that the method can be applied to any two corpora annotated with two own vocabularies.
We evaluate the resulting classifiers on two real-world use cases.
We evaluate the resulting classifiers on one with heterogeneous instances.
We evaluate the resulting classifiers on one with homogeneous.
The results illustrate the efficiency and generality of this method.
