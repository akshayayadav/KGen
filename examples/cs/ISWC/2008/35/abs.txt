Integration of heterogeneous services is often hard-wired in service or workflow implementations. In this paper we define an execution model operating on semantic descriptions of services allowing flexible integration of services with solving data and process conflicts where necessary. We implement the model using our WSMO technology and a case scenario from the B2B domain of the SWS Challenge.
