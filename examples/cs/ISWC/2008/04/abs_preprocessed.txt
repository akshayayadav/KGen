Navigational features have been largely recognized as fundamental for graph database query languages.
This fact has motivated several authors to propose RDF query languages with navigational capabilities.
In particular.
RDF that uses nested regular expressions as building blocks.
we have proposed the nSPARQL query language for RDF.
we have argued in a previous paper that nested regular expressions are appropriate to navigate RDF data.
In a previous paper that nested regular expressions are appropriate to navigate RDF data, we study some of the fundamental properties of nSPARQL concerning complexity of evaluation.

queries considering the semantics of the RDFS vocabulary by directly traversing the input graph.
Regarding expressiveness, we show that nSPARQL is expressive enough to answer queries.
we also show that nesting is necessary to obtain this last result.
we study the expressiveness of the combination of nested regular expressions.
we study the expressiveness of the combination of SPARQL operators.
Regarding complexity of evaluation, we prove that the evaluation of a nested regular expression E over an RDF graph G can be computed in time O ).
Regarding complexity of evaluation, we prove that the evaluation of a nested regular expression E over an RDF graph G can be computed in G Â· E ).
