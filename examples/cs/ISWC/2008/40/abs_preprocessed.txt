the Semantic Web Rule Language that admits reasoning in polynomial time.
We introduce extELP as a decidable fragment of the Semantic Web Rule Language.
extELP encompasses an extended notion of the recently proposed DL rules for that logic.
extELP is based on the tractable description logic EL.
features introduced by the forthcoming OWL 2, such as local reflexivity.
features introduced by the forthcoming OWL 2, such as certain range restrictions.
features introduced by the forthcoming OWL 2, such as disjoint roles.
features introduced by the forthcoming OWL 2, such as the universal role.
Thus extELP extends EL with a number of features.
a translation of extELP to Datalog also enables the seamless integration of DL-safe rules into extELP.
We present a reasoning algorithm based on a translation of extELP to Datalog.
the Description Logic Programming fragment of OWL 2.
DL-safe rules based on the Description Logic.
While reasoning with DL-safe rules as such is already highly intractable, we show that DL-safe rules can be admitted in extELP without losing tractability.
