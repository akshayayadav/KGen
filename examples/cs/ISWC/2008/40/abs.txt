We introduce 	extELP as a decidable fragment of the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) that admits reasoning in polynomial time. 	extELP is based on the tractable description logic EL^++, and encompasses an extended notion of the recently proposed DL rules for that logic. Thus 	extELP extends EL^++ with a number of features introduced by the forthcoming OWL 2, such as disjoint roles, local reflexivity, certain range restrictions, and the universal role. We present a reasoning algorithm based on a translation of 	extELP to Datalog, and this translation also enables the seamless integration of DL-safe rules into 	extELP. While reasoning with DL-safe rules as such is already highly intractable, we show that DL-safe rules based on the Description Logic Programming (DLP) fragment of OWL 2 can be admitted in 	extELP without losing tractability.
