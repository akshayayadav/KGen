The process of creating ontologies requires the active involvement of domain experts.
However, most domain experts find it hard to follow logical notations in OWL.
However, most domain experts lack knowledge modelling skills.
a tool that facilitates domain expertsâ€™ definition of ontologies in OWL by allowing domain experts to create the ontology in a controlled natural language.
a controlled natural language called Rabbit.
This paper presents a tool.
This paper presents ROO.
ROO guides users through the ontology construction process by following a methodology geared towards domain experts involvement in ontology authoring.
exploiting intelligent user interfaces techniques.
An evaluation study has been conducted comparing ROO against another popular ontology creating tool.
Participants were asked to create ontologies based on hydrology modelling scenarios.
hydrology modelling scenarios related to real tasks at the mapping agency of Great Britain.
environment modelling scenarios related to real tasks at the mapping agency of Great Britain.
Participants were asked to create ontologies based on environment modelling scenarios.
An evaluation study is discussed, focusing on the quality of the resultant ontologies.
An evaluation study is discussed, focusing on the usability and usefulness of the tool.
