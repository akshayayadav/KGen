The emerging paradigm of service-oriented computing requires novel techniques for various service-related tasks.
any large scale service environment where large numbers of clients interact.
Along with automated support for service discovery, selection support for automated service contracting and enactment is crucial for any large scale service environment.
Along with automated support for service discovery, negotiation support for automated service contracting and enactment is crucial for any large scale service environment.
any large scale service environment where large numbers of service providers interact.
Along with automated support for service discovery, composition support for automated service contracting and enactment is crucial for any large scale service environment.
a number of logic-based methods to handle Many problems in this area have emerged in the field of Semantic Web Services.
Many problems in this area involve reasoning.
previous work where we used Concurrent Transaction Logic to model about service contracts.
In this paper, we build upon we previous work.
previous work where we used Concurrent Transaction Logic to reason about service contracts.
we significantly extend the modeling power of the previous work by allowing iterative processes in the specification of service contracts.
we extend the proof theory of Concurrent Transaction Logic to enable reasoning about such contracts.
modeling general services represented using languages such as WS-BPEL.
With this extension, we logic-based approach is capable of modeling general services.
