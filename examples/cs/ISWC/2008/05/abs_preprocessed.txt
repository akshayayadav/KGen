Efficient RDF data management is one of the cornerstones in realizing the Semantic Web vision.
In the past, different RDF storage strategies have been proposed, ranging from simple triple stores to vertical partitioning on the predicates.
In the past, different RDF storage strategies have been proposed, ranging from simple triple stores to more advanced techniques like clustering.
We put the results into context by comparing the results to a purely relational model of the benchmark scenario.
We present an experimental comparison of existing storage strategies on top of the SP2Bench SPARQL performance benchmark suite.
approach when choosing a physical ) sort order, in We.
We observe that in terms of scalability a simple triple store is competitive to the vertically partitioned approach scenario with real-world queries, none of the approaches scales to documents containing tens of millions of RDF triples.

We observe that in terms of performance a simple triple store is competitive to the vertically partitioned approach scenario with real-world queries, none of the approaches scales to documents containing tens of millions of RDF triples.
a simple triple store built on top of a column-store DBMS.
We observe that none of the approaches can compete with a purely relational model.
We conclude that future research is necessary to further bring forward RDF data management.
