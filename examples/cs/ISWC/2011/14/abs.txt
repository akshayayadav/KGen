Ontology verification is concerned with the relationship between the intended structures for an ontology and the models of the axiomatization of the ontology. The verification of a particular ontology requires characterization of the models of the ontology up to isomorphism and a proof that these models are equivalent to the intended structures for the ontology. In this paper we provide the verification of the ontology of time introduced by Hobbs and Pan, which is a first-order axiomatization of OWL-Time. We identify five modules within this ontology and present a complete account of the metatheoretic relationships among the modules and between other time ontologies for points and intervals.
