Nowadays communication exchanges are time consuming part of people’s job, especially for the so called knowledge workers.
Nowadays communication exchanges are an integral.
an organisation which is only shared with those immediately involved in the particular communication act.
Contents discussed during meetings, instant messaging exchanges, informal communication exchanges exchanges therefore constitute a potential source of knowledge within an organisation.
This work poses a knowledge management issue, as this kind of contents become “ buried knowledge ”.
knowledge enabling topic trends spotting.
This work uses semantic technologies to extract buried knowledge.
knowledge enabling expertise finding spotting.
Specifically we claim it is possible to automatically model people’s expertise by annotating people's content to derive dynamic user profiles.
Specifically we claim it is possible to automatically model people’s expertise by monitoring informal communication exchanges.
Profiles are then used to calculate similarity between people.
Profiles are then used to calculate plot semantic knowledge-based networks.
a semantic network which reflects people expertise rather than capturing social interactions.
semantic concepts captured from informal content to build a semantic network.
The major contribution and novelty of This work is the exploitation of semantic concepts.
the group collected over a ten months period.
the approach using contents from a research group internal mailing list, using informal communication exchanges exchanges within the group.
We validate the approach.
