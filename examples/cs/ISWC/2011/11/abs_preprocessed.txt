querying are two well-known paradigms to search the Semantic Web.
Faceted search are two well-known paradigms to search the Semantic Web.
Querying languages, such as SPARQL, offer expressive means for searching RDF datasets.
Querying languages, such as SPARQL, are difficult to use.
Query assistants help users to write well-formed queries.
Query assistants do not prevent empty results.
navigation that returns rich feedbacks to users.
Faceted search supports exploratory search, and guided navigation and prevents rich feedbacks to fall in dead-ends ).
Faceted search supports exploratory search, and guided navigation and prevents rich feedbacks to fall in empty results ).
However, faceted search systems do not offer the same expressiveness as query languages.
We introduce Query-based Faceted Search the combination of faceted search to reconcile the two paradigms.
We introduce Query-based Faceted Search ( QFS ) to reconcile the two paradigms.
We introduce Query-based Faceted Search the combination of an expressive query language to reconcile the two paradigms.
In this paper, the LISQL query language generalizes existing semantic faceted search systems.
In this paper, the LISQL query language covers most features of SPARQL.
A prototype, Sewelis ( aka.
Camelis 2 ), has been implemented.
Camelis 2 ), a usability evaluation demonstrated that QFS enables users to build complex queries with little training.
Camelis 2 ), a usability evaluation demonstrated that QFS retains the ease-of-use of faceted search.
