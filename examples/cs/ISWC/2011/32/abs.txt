What is the most intuitive way of organizing concepts for describing things? What are the most relevant types of things that people use for describing other things? Wikipedia and Linked Data offer knowledge engineering researchers a chance to empirically identifying invariances in conceptual organization of knowledge i.e. knowledge patterns. In this paper, we present a resource of Encyclopedic Knowledge Patterns that have been discovered by analyizing the Wikipedia page links dataset, describe their evaluation with a user study, and discuss why it enables a number of research directions contributing to the realization of a meaningful Semantic Web.
