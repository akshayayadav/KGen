Concept diagrams were introduced for precisely specifying ontologies in a manner more readily accessible to other stakeholders than symbolic notations.
Concept diagrams were introduced for precisely specifying ontologies in a manner more readily accessible to developers than symbolic notations.
In this paper, we present a case study on the use of concept diagrams in visually specifying the Semantic Sensor Networks ontology.
visually specifying the Semantic Sensor Networks -RRB- ontology was originally developed by an Incubator Group of the W3C.

We consider the lessons show how to convert description logic axioms into concept diagrams.
We consider the lessons learnt from developing this visual model.
We also demonstrate how to merge simple concept diagram axioms into more complex axioms, whilst ensuring that diagrams remain relatively uncluttered.
