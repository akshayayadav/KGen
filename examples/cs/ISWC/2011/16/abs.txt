Concept diagrams were introduced for precisely specifying ontologies in a manner more readily accessible to developers and other stakeholders than symbolic notations. In this paper, we present a case study on the use of concept diagrams in visually specifying the Semantic Sensor Networks (SSN) ontology. The SSN ontology was originally developed by an Incubator Group of the W3C. In the ontology, a sensor is a physical object that implements sensing and an observation is observed by a single sensor. These, and other, roles and concepts are captured visually, but precisely, by concept diagrams. We consider the lessons learnt from developing this visual model and show how to convert description logic axioms into concept diagrams. We also demonstrate how to merge simple concept diagram axioms into more complex axioms, whilst ensuring that diagrams remain relatively uncluttered.
