an entity taken with reference to another entity.
Referential qualities are qualities of an entity.
For example the vulnerability of a coast to sea level rise.
In contrast to most non-relational qualities which only depend on most non-relational qualities host, referential qualities require a referent additional to their host, i.e. a quality Q of an entity X.
an entity X taken with reference to another entity R.
ecological systems which make concepts from these systems.
these systems challenging to model in formal ontology.
referential qualities occur frequently in ecological systems.
In this paper, we discuss exemplary resilience, vulnerability and affordance as qualities of an entity.
an entity taken with reference to an external factor.
We suggest an ontology design pattern for referential qualities.
The design pattern is anchored in the foundational ontology DOLCE and evaluated using implementations for the notions affordance.
The design pattern is anchored in the foundational ontology DOLCE and evaluated using implementations for the notions resilience.
The design pattern is anchored in the foundational ontology DOLCE and evaluated using implementations for the notions vulnerability.
