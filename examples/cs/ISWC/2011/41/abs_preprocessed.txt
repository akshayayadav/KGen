Ontology matching is a task.
a task that has attracted considerable attention in recent years.
With very few exceptions, however, research in ontology matching has focused primarily on the development of monolingual matching algorithms.
ontologies which do not share any languages.
As more resources become available in more than one language, novel algorithms are required which are capable of matching ontologies.

two ontologies using a small set of manually aligned concepts.
In this paper, we discuss several approaches to learning a matching function between two ontologies and evaluate two ontologies in cross-lingual scenarios.
In addition to this, as current research on ontology matching does not make a satisfactory distinction between multilingual we provide precise definitions of these terms in relation to monolingual ontology matching.
In addition to this, as current research on ontology matching does not make a satisfactory distinction between cross-lingual ontology matching we provide precise definitions of these terms in relation to monolingual ontology matching.
In addition to this, as current research on ontology matching does not make a satisfactory distinction between cross-lingual ontology matching we quantify these terms in relation effects on different matching algorithms.
