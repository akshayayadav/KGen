the evolution proved the evolution importance.
Recent studies of the topic mostly focussed on model-based approaches.
model-based approaches where an evolution ( of a KB ) results in a set of models.
it was shown that the evolution suffers from inexpressibility.
KBs expressed in tractable DLs, such as DL − Lite.
For KBs.
the result of evolution can not be expressed in DL − Lite.
What is missing in these studies is understanding: in which DL − Lite fragments evolution can be captured, what causes the inexpressibility is sufficient to express evolution, whether one can approximate the inexpressibility in DL − Lite.
the inexpressibility which logics.

We found what causes inexpressibility.
We found what isolated a fragment of DL − Lite.
DL − Lite where evolution is expressible.
For a fragment of DL − Lite We provided polynomial-time algorithms to compute evolution results.
DL − Lite where evolution is expressible.
For the general case We proposed techniques ( based on what We called prototypes ) to capture DL − Lite evolution corresponding to a well-known Winslett’s approach in a DL SHOIQ ( which is subsumed by OWL 2 DL ).
We also showed how to approximate this evolution in DL − Lite.
