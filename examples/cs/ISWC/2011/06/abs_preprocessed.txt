When thousands of vocabularies having been published on the Semantic Web by various authorities, a question arises as to how thousands of vocabularies are related to each other.
Existing work has mainly analyzed Existing work similarity.
In this paper, we characterize closeness in expressivity.
In this paper, we inspect the more general notion of relatedness.
In this paper, we characterize distributional relatedness.
In this paper, we characterize the more general notion of relatedness from four angles: well-defined semantic relatedness, lexical similarity in contents.
a large, real data set containing 2,996 vocabularies.
We present 15 million RDF documents that use 2,996 vocabularies.
We present an empirical study of these measures on a large, real data.
Then, we propose to apply vocabulary relatedness to the problem of post-selection vocabulary recommendation.
we test a recommender service as part of a vocabulary search engine effectiveness against a handcrafted gold standard.
we implement such a recommender service as part of a vocabulary search engine.
