In a semantic P2P network, peers rely on alignments between peers ontologies for translating queries.
In a semantic P2P network, peers use separate ontologies.
Nonetheless, alignments may be limited— unsound.
Nonetheless, alignments may be limited— incomplete.
Nonetheless, alignments may generate flawed translations, leading to unsatisfactory answers.
a trust mechanism that can assist peers to select those in the network.
the network that are better suited to answer those in the network.
the network that are better suited to answer their queries queries.
In this paper we present a trust mechanism.
The trust that a peer has towards another peer represents the probability that the latter peer will provide a satisfactory answer.
The trust that a peer has towards another peer depends on a specific query.
In order to compute trust, we exploit both alignments.
In order to compute trust, we exploit peers’ direct experience.
In order to compute trust, we perform Bayesian inference.
We have implemented We technique.
We conducted an evaluation.
answers received.
Experimental results showed that trust values converge as more queries are sent.
Furthermore, the use of trust improves both recall.
Furthermore, the use of trust improves both precision.
