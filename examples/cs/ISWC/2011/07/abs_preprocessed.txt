Linked Data is developing towards a large, global repository for structured, interlinked descriptions of real-world entities.
An emerging problem in many Web applications making use of data like Linked Data is how a lengthy description can be tailored to the task of quickly identifying the underlying entity.
As a solution to this novel problem of entity summarization, we propose RELIN.
the random surfer model that leverages the relatedness and informativeness of description elements for ranking.
As a solution to this novel problem of entity summarization, we propose a variant of the random surfer model.
description elements based on linguistic theory concepts.
description elements based on information theory concepts.
We present an implementation of this conceptual model.
this conceptual model which captures the semantics of description elements.
In experiments involving users our approach outperforms the baselines shown to be useful in a concrete task.

the baselines producing summaries that better match handcrafted ones and further.
