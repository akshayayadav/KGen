In this paper, we present an approach to determining the cognitive complexity of justifications for entailments of OWL ontologies.
experiments involving OWL users.
We introduce a simple cognitive complexity model.
We present the results of validating that model via experiments.
test data derived from a large corpus of naturally occurring justifications.
The validation is based on test data.
test data derived from a diverse corpus of naturally occurring justifications.
We contributions include an experimental protocol suitable for model validation and refinement.
We contributions include validation for the cognitive complexity model.
We contributions include new insights into justification complexity.
We contributions include a significant corpus with novel analyses of justifications suitable for experimentation.
