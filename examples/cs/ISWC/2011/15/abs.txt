In this paper, we present an approach to determining the cognitive complexity of justifications for entailments of OWL ontologies. We introduce a simple cognitive complexity model and present the results of validating that model via experiments involving OWL users. The validation is based on test data derived from a large and diverse corpus of naturally occurring justifications. Our contributions include validation for the cognitive complexity model, new insights into justification complexity, a significant corpus with novel analyses of justifications suitable for experimentation, and an experimental protocol suitable for model validation and refinement.
