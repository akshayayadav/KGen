LogMap— a highly scalable ontology matching system with diagnosis capabilities.
LogMap— a highly scalable ontology matching system with ‘ built-in ’ reasoning.
In this paper, we present LogMap— a highly scalable ontology.
semantically rich ontologies containing tens ) of thousands of classes.
To the best of our knowledge, LogMap's is the only matching system.
the only matching system that can deal with semantically rich ontologies.
semantically rich ontologies containing and even hundreds ) of thousands of classes.
In contrast to most existing tools, LogMap's also implements algorithms for ‘ on the fly ’ unsatisfiability detection and repair.
our experiments with the ontologies SNOMED CT confirm that our system can efficiently match even the largest existing bio-medical ontologies.
our experiments with the ontologies NCI CT confirm that our system can efficiently match even the largest existing bio-medical ontologies.
our experiments with the ontologies FMA CT confirm that our system can efficiently match even the largest existing bio-medical ontologies.
Furthermore, LogMap's is able to produce a ‘ clean ’ set of output mappings in many cases, in the sense that the ontology is consistent.
Furthermore, LogMap's is able to produce a ‘ clean ’ set of output mappings in many cases, in the sense that the ontology does not contain unsatisfiable classes.
the ontology obtained by integrating LogMap’s output mappings with the input ontologies.
