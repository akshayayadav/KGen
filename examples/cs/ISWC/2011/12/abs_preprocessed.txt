an explicit interpretation phase that maps keywords in a keyword query to structured query constructs.
Effective techniques for keyword search over RDF databases incorporate an explicit interpretation phase.
Because of the ambiguity of keyword queries, it is often not possible to generate a unique interpretation for a keyword query.
Consequently, heuristics geared toward generating the top-K likeliest user-intended interpretations have been proposed.
However, heuristics currently proposed fail to capture any user-dependent characteristics.
database-dependent properties such as occurrence frequency of subgraph pattern connecting keywords.
However, heuristics currently proposed fail to depend on database-dependent properties such as occurrence frequency of subgraph pattern.
This leads to the problem of generating top-K interpretations.
top-K interpretations that are not aligned with user intentions.
keyword query interpretation that personalizes the interpretation process based on a userâ€™s query context.
In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for keyword query interpretation.
structured queries corresponding to interpretations of keyword queries.
Our approach addresses the novel problem of using a sequence of structured queries in the query history as contextual information for biasing the interpretation of a new query.
Experimental results show that Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art technique on both efficiency and effectiveness, particularly for ambiguous queries.
