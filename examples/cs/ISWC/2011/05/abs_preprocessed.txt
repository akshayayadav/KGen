Triple stores have long provided RDF storage access.
Triple stores have long provided data access.
access using expressive, formal query languages such as SPARQL.
The new end users of the Semantic Web, however, are mostly unaware of SPARQL.
The new end users of the Semantic Web, however, overwhelmingly prefer imprecise, informal keyword queries for searching over data.
the architectures that provide support for the full expressivity of SPARQL.
At the same time, the amount of data on the Semantic Web is approaching the limits of the architectures.
RDF data using Information Retrieval methods.
These factors combined.
These factors have led to an increased interest in semantic search, i.e. access to RDF data.
In this work, we propose a method for efficient entity search over RDF data.
In this work, we propose a method for effective entity search over RDF data.
we describe an adaptation of the BM25F ranking function for RDF data.
we demonstrate that RDF outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in ranking RDF resources.
we also propose a set of new index structures for efficient retrieval and ranking of these results.
these results using the open-source MG4J framework.
we implement these results.
