Answering (conjunctive) queries is an important reasoning task in Description Logics (DL), hence also in highly expressive ontology languages, such as OWL. Extending such ontology languages with rules, such as those expressible in RIF-Core, and further with non-monotonic rules, integrating default negation as described in the RIF-FLD, yields an even more expressive language that allows for modeling defaults, exceptions, and integrity constraints.
