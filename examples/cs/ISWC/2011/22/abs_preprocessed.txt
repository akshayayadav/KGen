A natural goal for facilitating the re-use and re-combination of such content is to model usage policies as part of the data so as to enable the data exchange.
A natural goal for facilitating the re-use and re-combination of such content is to model usage policies as part of the data so as to enable automated processing.
This paper thus proposes a concrete policy modelling language.
ShareAlike that mandate that derived content is published under some license with the same permissions and requirements.
A particular difficulty are self-referential policies such as Creative Commons ShareAlike.
We present a general semantic framework for evaluating such recursive statements, show that a general semantic framework for evaluating such recursive statements explain how it can be evaluated using existing tools.
We present a general semantic framework for evaluating such recursive statements, show that a general semantic framework for evaluating such recursive statements has desirable formal properties.
We then show that We approach illustrate how one can concretely model self-referential policies in these languages to obtain desired conclusions.
We then show that We approach is compatible with both OWL DL.
We then show that We approach is compatible with both Datalog.
