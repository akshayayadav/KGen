the entities need to have These labels in order to be exposable to humans in a meaningful way.
These labels can then be used for displaying the entities in other front-end applications.
These labels can then be used for exploring the data.
These labels can then be used for displaying the entities in to support natural-language based search over the Web of Data.
These labels can then be used for displaying the entities in a linked data browser.
These labels can then be used for displaying the entities in to support keyword-based based search over the Web of Data.
Far too many applications fall back to exposing the URIs of the entities to the user in the absence of more easily understandable representations such as human-readable labels.
In this work we introduce the efficient accessibility of the labels.
In this work we introduce unambiguity of labeling.
In this work we introduce the multilinguality of the labeling.
In this work we introduce completeness of the labeling.
In this work we introduce a number of label-related metrics.
Data using these metrics.
we report we findings from measuring the Web of Data.
we also investigate which properties are used for labeling purposes, since many vocabularies define further labeling properties beyond the standard property from RDFS.
