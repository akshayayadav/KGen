The proliferation of semantic data on the Web requires RDF database systems to constantly improve their scalability and transactional efficiency. At the same time, users are increasingly interested in investigating or visualizing large collections of online data by performing complex analytic queries. This paper introduces a novel database system for RDF data management called dipLODocus_	iny[RDF] , which supports both transactional and analytical queries efficiently. dipLODocus_	iny[RDF]  takes advantage of a new hybrid storage model for RDF data based on recurring graph patterns. In this paper, we describe the general architecture of our system and compare its performance to state-of-the-art solutions for both transactional and analytic workloads.
