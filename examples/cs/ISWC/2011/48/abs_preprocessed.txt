The proliferation of semantic data on the Web requires RDF database systems to constantly improve RDF database systems scalability.
The proliferation of semantic data on the Web requires RDF database systems to constantly improve transactional efficiency.
At the same time, users are increasingly interested in investigating.
At the same time, users are increasingly interested in visualizing large collections of online data by performing complex analytic queries.
dipLODocus _ inyRDF which supports both transactional and analytical queries efficiently.
This paper introduces a novel database system for RDF data management called dipLODocus _ inyRDF.
dipLODocus _ inyRDF takes advantage of a new hybrid storage model for RDF data based on recurring graph patterns.
In This paper, we describe the general architecture of we system.
In This paper, we compare our system performance to state-of-the-art solutions for both analytic workloads.
