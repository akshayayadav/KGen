2 reasoners which in some cases fail to derive all answers to a query.
The need for scalable query answering often forces Semantic Web applications to use incomplete OWL 2 reasoners.
in some applications may even be unacceptable.
This is clearly undesirable.
the problem of ‘ repairing ’ an ontology T– computing an ontology R such that a reasoner becomes complete when used with T ∪ R.
a reasoner that is incomplete for T.
an ontology T– that is.
an ontology T– that is.
To address this problem, we investigate the problem of ‘ repairing ’ an ontology T–.
a preliminary evaluation which shows that, in some realistic cases, repairs are feasible to compute.
the reasoner that make this possible, present a practical algorithm for computing R.
We identify conditions on the reasoner and present a preliminary evaluation reasonable in size, and do not significantly affect reasoner performance.
