The purpose of data browsers is to help users query data effectively without being overwhelmed by large complex graphs of data.
A proposed solution to query data in graph-based datasets is a many-to-many graph.

technique that allows users to navigate the graph by starting from a set of instances.

instances followed by navigation through common links.
Relying solely on navigation, however, makes it difficult for users to even see if the element of interest is in the graph.
Relying solely on navigation, however, makes it difficult for users to find paths.
the graph when the points of interest may be many vertices apart.
Further challenges include finding paths.
paths which require combinations of backward links in order to make the necessary connections.
the necessary connections which further adds to the complexity of pivoting.
paths which require combinations of forward links in order to make the necessary connections.
In order to diminish the effects of these problems present a multi-pivot approach which we embodied in tool.
tool called Visor.
Visor allows users to explore from multiple points in the graph, helping users connect key points of interest in the graph on the conceptual level, visually occluding the remainder parts of the graph, thus helping create a road-map for navigation.
We carried out an user study to demonstrate the viability of the approach.
