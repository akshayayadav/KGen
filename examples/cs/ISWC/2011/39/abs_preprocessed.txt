Recently much attention has been directed to extending logic programming with description logic ( DL ) expressions, so that logic programs thus are able to reason with ontologies in the Semantic Web.
Recently much attention has been directed to extending logic programming with description logic ( DL ) expressions, so that logic programs have access to DL knowledge bases.
DL expressions called normal DL logic programs.
In this paper, we propose a new extension of logic programs with DL expressions.

We extend the key condition of well-supportedness for normal logic programs under the standard answer set semantics to normal DL logic programs.
DL logic programs which satisfies the extended well-supportedness condition.
We show that the answer is decidable if the underlying description logic is decidable ( e.g.
