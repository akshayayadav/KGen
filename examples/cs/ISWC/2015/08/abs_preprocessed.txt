As the Web of Data is growing steadily, the demand for user-friendly means for exploring, analyzing Linked Data is also increasing.
As the Web of Data is growing steadily, the demand for user-friendly means for exploring, visualizing Linked Data is also increasing.
The key challenge for visualizing Linked Data consists in supporting non-technical users in finding suitable visualizations while hiding technical details of visualization configuration.
The key challenge for visualizing Linked Data consists in supporting non-technical users in finding suitable visualizations while hiding technical details of Linked Data.
The key challenge for visualizing Linked Data consists in providing a clear overview of Linked Data.
In order to accomplish this, we propose a largely automatic workflow which guides users through the process of creating visualizations by automatically categorizing.
In order to accomplish this, we propose a largely automatic workflow which guides users through binding data to visualization parameters.
The approach is based on a heuristic analysis of the structure of the input data.
a comprehensive visualization model facilitating the automatic binding between data.
a comprehensive visualization model facilitating the automatic binding between visualization parameters.
The approach is based on a comprehensive visualization model.
The resulting assignments are ranked to the user.
The resulting assignments are presented to the user.
With LinkDaViz we provide a web-based implementation of the approach.
With LinkDaViz we demonstrate the feasibility by performance evaluation.
With LinkDaViz we demonstrate the feasibility by an extended user.
