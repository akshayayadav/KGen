Besides storing facts about the world, schema-based knowledge graphs are backed by rich semantic descriptions of relation-types.

Besides storing facts about the world, schema-based knowledge graphs are backed by rich semantic descriptions of entities.

In this work, we study how type-constraints can generally support the statistical modeling with latent variable models.
More precisely, we integrated prior knowledge in form of type-constraints in various state of the art latent variable approaches.
we experimental results show that prior knowledge on relation-types significantly improves Latent variable models up to 77.
