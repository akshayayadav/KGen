Algebras of relations were shown useful in managing ontology alignments.
Algebras of relations make it possible to aggregate alignments conjunctively.
Algebras of relations make it possible to aggregate alignments disjunctively.
to propagate alignments within a network of ontologies.
The previously contains taxonomical relations between classes.
The previously considered algebra of relations.
classes which occur in alignments.
compositional inference using this algebra.
However, compositional inference is sound only if we assume that classes have nonempty extensions.
Moreover, this algebra covers relations only between classes.
all qualitative taxonomical relations that occur between concepts including the relations.
all qualitative taxonomical relations that occur between individuals including the relations.
Here we introduce a new algebra of relations, which, first, solves second incorporates all qualitative taxonomical relations “ is a ” and “ is not ”.
Here we introduce a new algebra of relations, which, first, solves the limitation of the previous one incorporates all qualitative taxonomical relations “ is a ” and “ is not ”.
We prove that this algebra is coherent with respect to the simple semantics of alignments.
