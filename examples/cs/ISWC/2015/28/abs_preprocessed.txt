The dynamic nature of Web data gives rise to a multitude of problems the curators of biological information where changes are constant.
The dynamic nature of Web data gives rise to a multitude of problems the curators of biological information where changes are interrelated.
a framework that enables identifying, analysing these dynamics.
In this paper, we propose a framework.
a framework that enables identifying, understanding these dynamics.
we approach is flexible enough to capture the peculiarities and needs of different applications on dynamic data, while being formally robust due to the satisfaction of the unambiguity properties.

queries involving both changes.
In addition, we framework allows the persistent representation of the detected changes between versions, in a manner.
a manner that enables easy navigation among versions, automated processing and analysis of changes, cross-snapshot queries ( spanning across different versions ).
