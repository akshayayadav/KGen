The original SPARQL proposal was often criticized for its inability to navigate through the structure of RDF documents. For this reason property paths were introduced in SPARQL 1.1, but up to date there are no theoretical studies examining how their addition to the language affects main computational tasks such as query evaluation, query containment, and query subsumption. In this paper we tackle all of these problems and show that although the addition of property paths has no impact on query evaluation, they do make the containment and subsumption problems substantially more difficult.
