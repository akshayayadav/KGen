The original SPARQL proposal was often criticized for The original SPARQL proposal inability to navigate through RDF.
up to date there are no theoretical studies.
For this reason property paths were introduced in SPARQL 1.1.
no theoretical studies examining how property paths addition to the language affects main computational tasks such as query containment.
no theoretical studies examining how property paths addition to the language affects main computational tasks such as query evaluation.
no theoretical studies examining how property paths addition to the language affects main computational tasks such as query subsumption.
In this paper we tackle all of these problems.
In this paper we show that although the addition of property paths has no impact on query evaluation, property paths do make the containment problems substantially more difficult.
