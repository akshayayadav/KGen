Semantic relatedness are fundamental problems for linking text documents to the Web of Data.
disambiguation are fundamental problems for linking text documents to the Web of Data.
many approaches dealing with both most of both problems rely on concept distribution over Wikipedia.
many approaches dealing with both most of both problems rely on word distribution over Wikipedia.
There are many approaches.
many approaches dealing with both problems rely on concept distribution over Wikipedia.
many approaches dealing with both problems rely on word distribution over Wikipedia.
both problems are therefore not applicable to concepts.
concepts that do not have a rich textual description.
In this paper, we show that semantic relatedness can also be accurately computed by analysing only the graph structure of the knowledge base.
In addition, we propose a joint approach to entity disambiguation.
entity disambiguation that makes use of graph-based relatedness.
In addition, we propose a joint approach to word-sense disambiguation.
word-sense disambiguation that makes use of graph-based relatedness.
As opposed to the majority of state-of-the-art systems entities, we use we approach to disambiguate both entities.
state-of-the-art systems that target mainly named.
As opposed to the majority of state-of-the-art systems entities, we use we approach to disambiguate both common nouns.
In we experiments, we first validate we relatedness measure on multiple knowledge bases.
In we experiments, we first validate we relatedness measure on ground truth datasets.
In we experiments, we first show that our relatedness measure performs better than related state-of-the-art graph.
related state-of-the-art graph based measures.
Afterwards, we evaluate the disambiguation algorithm.
Afterwards, we show that the disambiguation algorithm also achieves superior disambiguation accuracy with respect to alternative state-of-the-art graph-based algorithms.
