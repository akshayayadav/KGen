an ontology that acts as a conceptual, integrated view of the data to the data sources.
declarative mappings that connect an ontology.
Ontology-based data access is a recent paradigm for accessing data sources through an ontology.
an ontology that acts as a conceptual, integrated view of the data.
Ontology-based data access is a recent paradigm for accessing data sources through declarative mappings.
We study the formal analysis of mappings in Ontology-based data access.
Specifically, We focus on the problem of identifying two of the most important anomalies for mappings in Ontology-based data access.
Specifically, We focus on the problem of identifying mapping inconsistency and redundancy .
ontology languages that comprises OWL 2.
ontology languages that comprises all OWL 2 profiles.
ontology languages that examine mapping languages of different expressiveness over relational databases.
We consider a wide range of ontology languages.
the decision problems associated with mapping inconsistency and redundancy.
We establish tight complexity bounds for the decision problems.
We provide algorithms.
We results prove that, in We general framework, such forms of mapping analysis enjoy nice computational properties, in the sense that such forms of mapping analysis are not harder than standard reasoning tasks over an ontology.
an ontology that acts over the relational database schema.
an ontology that acts as a conceptual, integrated view of the data.
