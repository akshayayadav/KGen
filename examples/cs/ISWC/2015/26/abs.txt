We tackle the problem of resolving coreferences in textual content by leveraging Semantic Web techniques. Specifically, we focus on noun phrases that coreference identifiable entities that appear in the text; the challenge in this context is to improve the coreference resolution by leveraging potential semantic annotations that can be added to the identified mentions. Our system, SANAPHOR, first applies state-of-the-art techniques to extract entities, noun phrases, and candidate coreferences. Then, we propose an approach to type noun phrases using an inverted index built on top of a Knowledge Graph (e.g., DBpedia). Finally, we use the semantic relatedness of the introduced types to improve the state-of-the-art techniques by splitting and merging coreference clusters. We evaluate SANAPHOR on CoNLL datasets, and show how our techniques consistently improve the state of the art in coreference resolution.
