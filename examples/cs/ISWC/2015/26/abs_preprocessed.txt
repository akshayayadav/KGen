We tackle the problem of resolving coreferences in textual content by leveraging Semantic Web techniques.
potential semantic annotations that can be added to the identified mentions.
noun phrases that coreference identifiable entities.
identifiable entities that appear in the text.
Specifically, We focus on noun phrases the challenge in this context is to improve the coreference resolution by leveraging potential semantic annotations.
We system, SANAPHOR, first applies state-of-the-art techniques to extract candidate coreferences.
We system, SANAPHOR, first applies state-of-the-art techniques to extract entities.
We system, SANAPHOR, first applies state-of-the-art techniques to extract noun phrases.
Then, We propose an approach to type noun phrases.
an inverted index built on top of e.g., DBpedia ).
type noun phrases using an inverted index.
an inverted index built on top of a Knowledge Graph ).
merging coreference clusters.
Finally, We use the semantic relatedness of the introduced types to improve the state-of-the-art techniques by splitting.
We evaluate SANAPHOR on CoNLL datasets.
We show how We techniques consistently improve the state of the art in coreference resolution.
