Instance retrieval computes all instances of a given concept in DL ) ontology.
Instance retrieval computes all instances of a given concept in a consistent description logic ) ontology.
Although Instance retrieval is a popular task for ontology reasoning, there is no scalable method for instance retrieval for negated concepts by now.
This paper studies a new approach to instance retrieval for negated concepts.
This paper studies a new approach to instance retrieval for negated concepts based on query rewriting.
The IFO-rewritable class called IFO-rewritable ) class is identified.
The IFO-rewritable class called the inconsistency-based first-order rewritable ) class is identified.
The IFO-rewritable class guarantees that instance retrieval for an atomic negation can be reduced to answering a disjunction of conjunctive queries ( CQs ) over the ABox.
The IFO-rewritable class is more expressive than the first-order rewritable class.
the first-order rewritable class which guarantees that answering a CQ is reducible to answering a disjunction of CQs over the ABox regardless of the TBox.
Two sufficient conditions are proposed to detect IFO-rewritable ontologies.
IFO-rewritable ontologies that are not first-order rewritable.
A rewriting-based method for retrieving instances of a negated concept is proposed for IFO-rewritable ontologies.
existing methods implemented in state-of-the-art DL systems.
Preliminary experimental results on retrieving instances of all atomic negations show that A rewriting-based method for retrieving instances of a negated concept is significantly more efficient than existing methods.
