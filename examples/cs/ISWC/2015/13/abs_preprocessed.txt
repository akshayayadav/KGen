EL-based ontologies which are defeasible in the sense that such a mapping only applies to individuals if this does not cause an inconsistency.
We present a novel approach to denote mappings between EL-based ontologies.
this provides the advantage of avoiding logical inconsistencies.
logical inconsistencies that may be caused due to the traditional type of mappings.
this provides the advantage of handling exceptions automatically.
We consider the case.
the case where mappings from many possibly heterogeneous ontologies are one-way links towards an overarching ontology.
Questions can then be asked in terms of the concepts in the overarching ontology.
We show that reasoning under such a setting is decidable even when the defeasible axioms apply to unknowns.
We provide the formal semantics for the defeasible mappings.
Furthermore, We show that the formal semantics for the defeasible mappings actually is strongly related to the idea of answer sets for logic programs.
