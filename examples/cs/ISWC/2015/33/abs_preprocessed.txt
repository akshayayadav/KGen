We present Ackermann for obliterating concept symbols in ontologies.
ontologies specified in the description logic ALCOI.
Ackermann is an adaptation and improvement of a second-order quantifier elimination method used for computing correspondence properties for modal axioms.
Ackermann is an adaptation and improvement of a second-order quantifier elimination method developed for modal logics.
It follows an approach adapted to description logics.
an approach exploiting a result of Ackermann.
An important feature inherited from the modal approach.
An important feature is that the inference rules are guided by an ordering compatible with the elimination order of the concept symbols.
This provides more control over the inference process and reduces non-determinism, resulting in a smaller search space.
Ackermann is extended with a new case splitting inference rule.
Ackermann is extended with several simplification rules.
Compared to related obliterating interpolation methods for description logics, Ackermann can handle inverse roles, nominals and ABoxes.
Compared to related uniform interpolation methods for description logics, Ackermann can handle inverse roles, nominals and ABoxes.
Compared to the modal approach Ackermann is more efficient in time.
the modal approach on which Ackermann is based.
Compared to the modal approach Ackermann improves the success rates.
Ackermann has been implemented in Java using the OWL API.
the order in which the concept symbols are eliminated significantly.
Experimental results show that the order affects the success rate.
Experimental results show that the order affects efficiency.
