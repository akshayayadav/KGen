Client-side query processing techniques provide a promising solution for Web query processing.
Client-side query processing techniques that rely on the materialization of fragments of the original RDF dataset.
performance of client-side execution plans can be negatively affected by live conditions where rate at which data arrive from sources changes.
the traditional optimize-then-execute paradigm used by existing approaches.
because of unexpected data transfers, the traditional optimize-then-execute paradigm is not always applicable in this context.
However.
Linked Data Eddies that is able to adjust query execution schedulers to data availability.
Linked Data Eddies that is runtime conditions.
We present a network of Linked Data Eddies.
We tackle adaptivity for client-side query processing.
Experimental studies suggest that the network of Linked Data Eddies outperforms static Web query schedulers in scenarios with unpredictable transfer delays.
Experimental studies suggest that the network of Linked Data Eddies outperforms static Web query schedulers in scenarios with data distributions.
