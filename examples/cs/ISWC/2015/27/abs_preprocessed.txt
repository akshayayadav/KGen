datasets which make entity retrieval a challenging task.
in particular of Linked Data, has led to a diverse landscape of datasets.
The increasing amount of data on the Web particular of Linked Data, has led to a diverse landscape of datasets.
Explicit cross-dataset links, for instance to indicate related entities can significantly improve entity retrieval.
Explicit cross-dataset links, for instance to indicate co-references can significantly improve entity retrieval.
However, only a small fraction of entities are interlinked through explicit statements.
In this paper, we propose a two-fold entity retrieval approach.
In a first , we cluster entities based on the x– means.
In a first , we cluster entities based on spectral clustering algorithms.
In offline preprocessing step, we cluster entities based on spectral clustering algorithms.
In offline preprocessing step, we cluster entities based on the x– means.
In the second step, we propose an precomputed clusters.
retrieval model which takes advantage of we.
an optimized retrieval model.
entities retrieved by a given user query.
the result set with relevant entities by considering features of the queries.
the result set with relevant entities by considering features of the precomputed clusters.
the result set with relevant entities by considering features of entities.
entities retrieved by the BM25F retrieval approach.
For a given set of entities we further expand the result.
the expanded result set with respect to the relevance to the query.
Finally, we re-rank the expanded result.
we perform a thorough experimental evaluation on BTC12 ) dataset.
we perform a thorough experimental evaluation on the Billions Triple Challenge ) dataset.
the BM25F retrieval approach shows significant improvements compared to the baseline and state of the art approaches.
