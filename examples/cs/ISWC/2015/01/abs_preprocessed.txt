In this paper we propose a general purpose recursion operator to formalize SPARQL syntax.
In this paper we propose a general purpose recursion operator to be added to SPARQL.
In this paper we propose a general purpose recursion operator to develop algorithms for evaluating SPARQL in practical scenarios.
we also show how to implement recursion as a plug-in on top of existing systems.
we also show how to test a plug-in performance on several real world datasets.
