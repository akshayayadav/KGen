Knowledge graphs are browsing.
Knowledge graphs are knowledge discovery activities.
Knowledge graphs are a key ingredient for searching.
Motivated by the need to harness knowledge available in a variety of Knowledge graphs, we face the following two problems.
First, given a pair of entities defined in some Knowledge graph, find an explanation of a pair of entities.
entities defined in some Knowledge graph relatedness.
We formalize the notion of relatedness explanation.
We introduce different criteria to build explanations based on diversity.
We introduce different criteria to build explanations based on information-theory.
entities defined in some Knowledge graph combinations.
We introduce different criteria to build explanations based on a pair of entities.
Second, given a pair of entities, find other ) entities.
other ) entities sharing a similar relatedness perspective.
Second, given a pair of entities, find pairs of ) entities.
pairs of ) entities sharing a similar relatedness perspective.
We describe an implementation of We ideas in a tool.
RECAP which is based on SPARQL.
a tool called RECAP.
RECAP which is based on RDF.
We provide an evaluation of RECAP.
We provide a comparison with related systems on real-world data.
