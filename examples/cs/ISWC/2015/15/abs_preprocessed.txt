data integration proposed by Falconer.
integration tools that generate potential schema mappings and users.
The iterative user interaction approach for data integration can be generalized to consider interactions between integration tools.
integration tools that generate analysis tools.
analysis tools that select the best mapping.
data integration proposed by Noy.
Each such selection then provides high-confidence guidance for the next iteration of the integration tool.
We have implemented this.
this generalized a matching system for both property.
this generalized instance alignments between heterogeneous data.
this generalized approach in CogMap.
The interactions between integration tool in CogMap presents high-quality property alignments to analysis tool.
The interactions between integration tool in CogMap presents The interactions between integration tool in CogMap consequences to analysis tool.
The interactions between integration tool in CogMap presents high-quality property alignments to the potential schema mappings and users.
The interactions between integration tool in CogMap uses the instance alignment from the previous iteration to create high-quality property alignments.
The interactions between integration tool in CogMap presents The interactions between integration tool in CogMap consequences to the potential schema mappings and users.
We experiments show that the interplay between property alignment serve to improve the final alignments.
We experiments show that the interplay between instance alignment serve to improve the final alignments.
We experiments show that multiple iterations serve to improve the final alignments.
