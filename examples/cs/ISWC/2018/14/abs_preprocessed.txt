We address the problem of finding descriptive explanations of stored in a knowledge graph.
This is important in high-risk domains such as healthcare, intelligence, etc. where users need additional information for decision making and is especially crucial for applications that rely on automatically constructed knowledge graphs where machine-learned systems extract facts from an input corpus and working of the extractors is opaque to the end-user.
We follow an approach inspired from information retrieval and propose a simple, yet effective and efficient solution that takes into account passage level as well as document level properties to produce a ranked list of passages describing a given input relation.
