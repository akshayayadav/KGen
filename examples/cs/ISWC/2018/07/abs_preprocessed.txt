Named Entity Typing is a challenging task, especially with long-tail entities such as found in scientific publications.
long-tail entities such as found in scientific publications are rare, often relevant only in specific knowledge domains, yet important for exploration purposes.
long-tail entities such as found in scientific publications are rare, often relevant only in specific knowledge domains, yet important for retrieval purposes.
State-of-the-art Entity Recognition approaches employ learning trained on expensive type-labeled data laboriously produced by human annotators.
A common workaround is the generation of labeled training data from knowledge bases; this approach is not suitable for long-tail entity types that are, by definition, scarcely represented in KBs.
This paper presents an iterative approach for training Entity Recognition and Entity Typing classifiers in scientific publications that relies on minimal human input, namely a small seed set of instances for the targeted entity type.
We introduce different strategies for training data extraction, semantic expansion,.
We result entity filtering.
We evaluate We approach on scientific publications, focusing on the long-tail entities types Datasets.
We evaluate We approach on scientific publications, focusing on Methods in computer science publications.
We evaluate We approach on scientific publications, focusing on Proteins in biomedical publications.
