Dealing with large tabular datasets often requires extensive preprocessing.
This preprocessing happens only once, so that loading the data in a database may be an overkill.

This preprocessing happens only once, so that loading the data in triple store may be an overkill.
In this paper, we present an approach that allows preprocessing large tabular data in Datalog-- without indexing the data.
The Datalog query is translated to Unix Bash.
The Datalog query can be executed in a shell.
we experiments show that, for the use case of data preprocessing, we approach is competitive with state-of-the-art systems in terms of scalability, while at the same time requiring only a Bash shell on a Unix system.
