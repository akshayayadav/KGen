We address the sequence relation between successive activities.
We address the concept of research activity.
We address the automatic extraction from publications of two key concepts for representing research processes.
These representations are driven by the Scholarly Ontology, specifically conceived for documenting research processes.
Unlike named entity recognition, we are facing textual descriptions of activities of widely variable length, while pairs of successive activities often span multiple sentences.
