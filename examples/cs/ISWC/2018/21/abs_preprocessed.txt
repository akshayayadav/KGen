This paper aims at approximating the representativeness of a relation within a knowledge base.
For this, we use the generalized Benford's law, which indicates the distribution expected by the facts of a relation.
We then compute the minimum number of facts that have to be added in order to make the Knowledge base representative of the real world.
Experiments show that our unsupervised method applies to a large number of relations.
For numerical relations where ground truths exist, the estimated representativeness proves to be a reliable indicator.
