We develop a declarative framework for privacy-preserving Linked Data publishing in which utility policies are specified as SPARQL queries.

We develop a declarative framework for privacy-preserving Linked Data publishing in which privacy policies are specified as SPARQL queries.
We approach leads to inspect utility policies in order to determine the sequence of anonymization operations applicable to any graph instance for satisfying the policies.
We approach is data-independent.
We approach leads to inspect only the privacy in order to determine the sequence of anonymization operations applicable to any graph instance for satisfying the policies.
We approach is data-independent.
We prove the soundness of We algorithms.
We gauge our algorithms performance through experiments.
