defined over templates support sophisticated maintenance tasks for sets of templates, such as suggesting new templates for representing implicit patterns.

Ontology templates are designed for practical use; an Open image in new window vocabulary, convenient serialisation formats for the semantic web and for terse specification of template definitions are available, including an open source implementation for using templates.

Our approach is successfully tested on a real-world large-scale ontology in the engineering domain.
