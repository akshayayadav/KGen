Converting data from diverse data sources to custom RDF datasets often faces several practical challenges transform the source data.
Converting data from diverse data sources to custom RDF datasets often faces related with the need to restructure.
Existing RDF mapping languages assume that the resulting datasets mostly preserve the structure of the source data.
In this paper, we present real cases that highlight the limitations of existing languages, and describe D2RML, a transformation-oriented RDF mapping language which addresses such practical needs by incorporating a programming flavor in the mapping process.
