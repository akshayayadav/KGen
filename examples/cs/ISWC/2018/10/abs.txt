Information extraction traditionally focuses on extracting relations between identifiable entities, such as \(\langle \)Monterey, locatedIn, California\(\rangle \). Yet, texts often also contain Counting information, stating that a subject is in a specific relation with a number of objects, without mentioning the objects themselves, for example, “California is divided into 58 counties”. Such counting quantifiers can help in a variety of tasks such as query answering or knowledge base curation, but are neglected by prior work.
