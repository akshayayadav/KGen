With the popularity of RDF as an independent data model came the need for specifying constraints on RDF graphs, and for mechanisms to detect violations of such constraints. One of the most promising schema languages for RDF is SHACL, a recent W3C recommendation. Unfortunately, the specification of SHACL leaves open the problem of validation against recursive constraints. This omission is important because SHACL by design favors constraints that reference other ones, which in practice may easily yield reference cycles.
