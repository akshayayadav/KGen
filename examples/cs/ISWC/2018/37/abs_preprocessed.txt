This study exploits expressed in RDF Knowledge Bases to enhance Truth Discovery performances.
Truth Discovery aims to identify facts -LRB- true claims -RRB- when conflicting claims are made by several sources.
Based on the assumption that true claims are provided by reliable sources and reliable sources provide true claims, Truth Discovery models iteratively compute source trustworthiness in order to determine which claims are true.
Based on the assumption that true claims are provided by reliable sources and reliable sources provide true claims, Truth Discovery models iteratively compute value confidence in order to determine which claims are true.
We propose a model that exploits the knowledge extracted from an existing RDF RDF Knowledge Base in the form of These rules.
These rules are used to quantify given by the RDF RDF Knowledge Base to support a claim.
the evidence is then integrated into the computation of the confidence value to improve the evidence estimation.
Enhancing Truth Discovery models efficiently obtains a larger set of reliable facts that vice versa can populate RDF RDF Knowledge Bases.
Empirical experiments on real-world datasets showed the potential of the proposed approach, which led to an improvement of up to 18 % compared to the model we modified.
