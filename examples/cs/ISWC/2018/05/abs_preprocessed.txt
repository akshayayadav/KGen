Named entity recognition and disambiguation are subtasks of information extraction that aim to recognize named entities mentioned in text, to assign them pre-defined types, and to link them with them matching entities in a knowledge base.
Many approaches, often exposed as web APIs, have been proposed to solve these tasks during the last years.
web APIs classify using different taxonomies with different knowledge bases.
web APIs classify using disambiguate web APIs with different knowledge bases.
In this paper, we describe Ensemble Nerd, a framework that collects numerous extractors responses, normalizes numerous extractors responses and combines numerous extractors responses in order to produce a final entity list according to the pattern -LRB- surface form, type, link -RRB-.
The presented approach is based on representing the extractors responses as real-value vectors and on using the extractors responses as input samples for two Deep Learning networks: ENNTR -LRB- Ensemble Neural Network for Type Recognition -RRB- and ENND -LRB- Ensemble Neural Network for Disambiguation -RRB-.
We train two Deep Learning networks: ENNTR -LRB- Ensemble Neural Network for Type Recognition -RRB- and ENND -LRB- Ensemble Neural Network for Disambiguation -RRB- using specific gold standards.
We show that the models produced outperform each single extractor responses in terms of computed by the GERBIL framework.
