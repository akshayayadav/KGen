Ontology summarization aspires to produce an abridged version of the original data source highlighting Ontology summarization most important concepts.
However, in an ideal scenario, the user should not be limited only to static summaries.
Starting from the summary, s/he should be able to further explore requesting more detailed information for a particular part of more detailed information.
In this paper, we present enabling the dynamic exploration of summaries through two novel operations zoom and extend.
Extend focuses on a specific subgraph of the initial summary, whereas zoom on the whole graph, both providing granular information access to the end-user.
We provide approximations for these operators calculation.
We show that calculating these operators is NP-complete.
Then, We show that using extend, we can answer focusing on specific nodes, whereas using global zoom, we can answer overall more queries.
Finally, We show that employed can efficiently approximate both operators.
