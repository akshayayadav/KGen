Ontology summarization aspires to produce an abridged version of the original data source highlighting its most important concepts. However, in an ideal scenario, the user should not be limited only to static summaries. Starting from the summary, s/he should be able to further explore the data source requesting more detailed information for a particular part of it. In this paper, we present a new approach enabling the dynamic exploration of summaries through two novel operations zoom and extend. Extend focuses on a specific subgraph of the initial summary, whereas zoom on the whole graph, both providing granular information access to the end-user. We show that calculating these operators is NP-complete and provide approximations for their calculation. Then, we show that using extend, we can answer more queries focusing on specific nodes, whereas using global zoom, we can answer overall more queries. Finally, we show that the algorithms employed can efficiently approximate both operators.
