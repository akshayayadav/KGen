Reusing existing datasets is of considerable significance to researchers and developers. Dataset search engines help a user find relevant datasets for reuse. They can present a snippet for each retrieved dataset to explain its relevance to the userâ€™s data needs. This emerging problem of snippet generation for dataset search has not received much research attention. To provide a basis for future research, we introduce a framework for quantitatively evaluating the quality of a dataset snippet. The proposed metrics assess the extent to which a snippet matches the query intent and covers the main content of the dataset. To establish a baseline, we adapt four state-of-the-art methods from related fields to our problem, and perform an empirical evaluation based on real-world datasets and queries. We also conduct a user study to verify our findings. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our evaluation framework, and suggest directions for future research.
