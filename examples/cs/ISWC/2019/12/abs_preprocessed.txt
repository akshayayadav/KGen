Wikipedia's categories are a rich source of taxonomic information.
Wikipedia's categories are a rich source of non-taxonomic information.
The category their nationality science fiction writers, for example, encodes their nationality and genre -LRB- Science Fiction -RRB-.
The category their nationality science fiction writers, for example, encodes the type of Wikipedia's resources -LRB- Science Fiction -RRB-.
Several approaches in the literature make use of fractions of encoded information without exploiting Wikipedia's full potential.
In this paper, we introduce an approach for the discovery of category axioms that uses information from the category network, category instances, and category instances lexicalisations.
