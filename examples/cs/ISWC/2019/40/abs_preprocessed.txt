While e-shops often embed certain categorisation information in Markup languages such as RDFa product data in order to improve Markup languages such as Microdata products' visibility to aggregator services, such site-specific product category labels are highly inconsistent and unusable across websites.

Using three new neural network models adapted based on previous work, we analyse the effect of different kinds of product markup data on this task, and show that: -LRB- 1 -RRB- despite the highly heterogeneous nature of the site-specific categories, products can be used as very effective features- even only by products- for the classification task; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- we best performing model can significantly improve state of the art on this task by up to 9.6 % points in macro-average F1.
