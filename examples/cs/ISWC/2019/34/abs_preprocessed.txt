Learning knowledge graph embeddings has received increasing attention in recent years.
Most embedding models in literature interpret relations as linear mapping functions to operate on entity embeddings.
Most embedding models in literature interpret relations as bilinear mapping functions to operate on entity embeddings.
However, we find that such relation-level modeling can not capture the diverse relational structures of KGs well.
In this paper, we propose a novel edge-centric embedding model TransEdge, which contextualizes relation representations in terms of specific head-tail entity pairs.
We refer to contextualized representations of a relation as edge embeddings.
We refer to such interpret representations of a relation as translations between entity embeddings.
a novel edge-centric embedding model TransEdge, which contextualizes relation representations in terms of specific head-tail entity pairs achieves promising performance on different prediction tasks.
We experiments on benchmark datasets indicate that a novel edge-centric embedding model TransEdge, which contextualizes relation representations in terms of specific head-tail entity pairs obtains the state-of-the-art results on embedding-based entity alignment.
We also show that a novel edge-centric embedding model TransEdge, which contextualizes relation representations in terms of specific head-tail entity pairs is complementary with conventional entity alignment methods.
Moreover, a novel edge-centric embedding model TransEdge, which contextualizes relation representations in terms of specific head-tail entity pairs shows very competitive performance on link prediction.
