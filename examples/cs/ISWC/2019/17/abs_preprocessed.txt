Ontology Design Patterns have been proposed to facilitate ontology engineering.
Despite numerous conceptual contributions for over more than a decade, there is little empirical work to support provided by ODPs.
Determining Ontology Design Patterns use from ontologies alone -LRB- without interviews or other supporting documentation -RRB- is challenging as there is no standard -LRB- or required -RRB- mechanism for stipulating the intended use of an Ontology Design Patterns.
Instead, we must rely on modelling features which are suggestive of a given Ontology Design Patterns's influence.
For the purpose of determining the prevalence of ODPs in ontologies, we developed a variety of these techniques to detect these features with varying degrees of liberality.
Using these techniques, we survey BioPortal with respect to well-known repositories for ODPs.
Using these techniques, we survey BioPortal with respect to publicly available repositories for ODPs.
we findings are predominantly negative.
For the vast majority of ODPs we can not find empirical evidence for the vast majority of ODPs use in biomedical ontologies.
