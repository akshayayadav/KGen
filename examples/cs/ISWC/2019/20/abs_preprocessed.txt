We propose a new end-to-end method for extending a Knowledge Graph from tables.
Existing techniques tend to interpret tables by focusing on information that is already in the a Knowledge Graph, and therefore tend to extract many redundant facts.
We method aims to find more novel facts.
We introduce a new technique for table interpretation based on using entity similarities.
Our method further disambiguates cell values using a Knowledge Graph embeddings as additional ranking method.
Other distinctive features are the lack of the enabling of a fine-grained tuning of the precision/recall trade-off of extracted facts.
Other distinctive features are the lack of assumptions about the underlying a Knowledge Graph.
We experiments show that We approach has a higher recall during the interpretation process than the state-of-the-art.
We experiments show that We approach is more resistant against observed in extracting mostly redundant facts since the state-of-the-art produces more novel extractions.
