Semantic Web connects huge knowledge bases whose content has been generated from collaborative platforms and by integration of heterogeneous databases.
Naturally, huge knowledge bases whose content has been generated from collaborative platforms and by integration of heterogeneous databases are incomplete and contain erroneous data.
Knowing huge knowledge bases whose content has been generated from collaborative platforms and by integration of heterogeneous databases data quality is an essential long-term goal to guarantee that querying huge knowledge bases whose content has been generated from collaborative platforms and by integration of heterogeneous databases returns reliable results.
Having cardinality constraints for roles described individuals from having data.
Having cardinality constraints for roles insufficiently informed.
Having cardinality constraints for roles would be an important advance to distinguish correctly.
Having cardinality constraints for roles would be an important advance to distinguish correctly and completely described individuals from having data either incorrect.
In this paper, we propose a method for automatically discovering from the knowledge base's content the maximum cardinality of roles for each concept, when the knowledge base's exists.
a method is robust thanks to the use of Hoeffding's inequality.
We also design an algorithm, named C3M, for an exhaustive search of such constraints in a knowledge base benefiting from pruning properties that drastically reduce the search space.
conducted on DBpedia also highlight the robustness of We method, with a precision higher than 95 %.
conducted on DBpedia demonstrate the scaling up of C3M method, with a precision higher than 95 %.
