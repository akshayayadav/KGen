Analytical queries are queries with numerical aggregators: computing the average number of objects per property, identifying the most frequent subjects.
Such queries are essential to monitor the content of the Linked Open Data cloud.
Such queries are essential to monitor the quality.
Many analytical queries can not be executed directly on the SPARQL endpoints, because the fair use policy cuts off expensive queries.
In this paper, we show how to rewrite such queries into a set of queries that each satisfy the fair use policy.
we then show how to execute these queries in such a way that the result provably converges to the exact query answer.
we algorithm is meaning that Our algorithm can give intermediate approximate results at any time point.
we experiments show that the approach converges rapidly towards the exact solution, and that the approach can compute even complex indicators at the scale of the Linked Open Data cloud.
