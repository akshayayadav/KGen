Knowledge Graphs are used in an increasing number of applications. Although considerable human effort has been invested into making knowledge graphs available in multiple languages, most knowledge graphs are in English. Additionally, regional facts are often only available in the language of the corresponding region. This lack of multilingual knowledge availability clearly limits the porting of machine learning models to different languages. In this paper, we aim to alleviate this drawback by proposing THOTH, an approach for translating and enriching knowledge graphs. THOTH extracts bilingual alignments between a source and target knowledge graph and learns how to translate from one to the other by relying on two different recurrent neural network models along with knowledge graph embeddings. We evaluated THOTH extrinsically by comparing the German DBpedia with the German translation of the English DBpedia on two tasks: fact checking and entity linking. In addition, we ran a manual intrinsic evaluation of the translation. Our results show that THOTH is a promising approach which achieves a translation accuracy of 88.56%. Moreover, its enrichment improves the quality of the German DBpedia significantly, as we report +18.4% accuracy for fact validation and +19% F\(_1\) for entity linking.
