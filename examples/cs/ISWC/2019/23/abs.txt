Link keys are recently introduced to formalize data interlinking between data sources. They are considered as a new kind of correspondences included in ontology alignments. We propose a procedure for reasoning in a decentralized manner on a network of ontologies with alignments containing link keys. In this paper, the ontologies involved in such a network are expressed in the logic \(\mathcal {ALC}\) while the alignments can contain concept, individual and link key correspondences equipped with a loose semantics. The decentralized aspect of our procedure is based on a process of knowledge propagation through the network via correspondences. This process allows to reduce polynomially global reasoning to local reasoning.
