Link keys are recently introduced to formalize interlinking between data sources.
Link keys are considered as a new kind of included in ontology alignments.
We propose a procedure for reasoning in a decentralized manner on a network of ontologies with containing link keys.
In this paper, the ontologies involved in such a network are expressed in the logic \ -LRB- \ mathcal -LCB- ALC -RCB- \ -RRB- while the alignments can contain concept, individual and link key correspondences equipped with a loose semantics.
The decentralized aspect of our procedure is based on a process of knowledge propagation through the network via correspondences.
a process of knowledge propagation allows to reduce polynomially global reasoning to local reasoning.
