This paper presents aiming at understanding the modeling style.
This paper presents aiming at understanding the overall semantic structure of Linked Open Data.
We observe how classes are used in practice.
We observe how individuals are used in practice.
We observe how properties are used in practice.
We also investigate how hierarchies of concepts are structured, and how much hierarchies of concepts are linked.
In addition to discussing the results, This paper contributes -LRB- i -RRB- a conceptual framework, including a set of metrics, which generalises over the observable constructs; -LRB- ii -RRB- an open source implementation that facilitates This paper application to other Linked Data knowledge graphs.
