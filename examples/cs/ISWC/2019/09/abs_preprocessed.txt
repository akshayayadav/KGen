The rapid progress of question answering -LRB- QA -RRB- systems over knowledge bases enables end users to acquire knowledge with natural language questions.
While mapping proper nouns and relational phrases to semantic constructs in The rapid progress of question answering -LRB- QA -RRB- systems over knowledge bases has been extensively studied, little attention has been devoted to adjectives, most of which play the role of factoid constraints on the modified nouns.
In this paper, we study the problem of finding appropriate representations for adjectives over The rapid progress of question answering -LRB- QA -RRB- systems over knowledge bases.
We propose called Adj2ER, to automatically map an adjective to several existential restrictions negation forms.
Specifically, we leverage statistic measures for generating candidate existential restrictions and supervised learning for filtering the candidates, which largely reduce the search space and overcome the lexical gap.
We create two question sets with adjectives from QALD.
We create two question sets with adjectives from Yahoo Answers.
We create two question sets with conduct experiments over DBpedia.
We experimental results show that Adj2ER can generate high-quality mappings for significantly outperform several alternative approaches.
We experimental results show that Adj2ER can generate high-quality mappings for most adjectives.
Furthermore, current QA systems can gain a promising improvement when integrating our adjective mapping approach.
