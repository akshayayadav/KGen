In this paper, we conduct an empirical investigation of neural query graph ranking approaches for the task of complex question answering over knowledge graphs. We propose a novel self-attention based slot matching model which exploits the inherent structure of query graphs, our logical form of choice. Our proposed model generally outperforms other ranking models on two QA datasets over the DBpedia knowledge graph, evaluated in different settings. We also show that domain adaption and pre-trained language model based transfer learning yield improvements, effectively offsetting the general lack of training data.
