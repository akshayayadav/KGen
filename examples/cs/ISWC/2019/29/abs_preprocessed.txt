linking is an important problem for knowledge graph-based Question Answering.
Given a natural language question, the task is to identify relevant relations from the given knowledge graph.
Given a knowledge graph, the task is to identify relevant relations from the given knowledge graph.
Since linking are more stable compared to linking, our idea is to exploit extracted from the question to support linking.
Since existing techniques for entity extraction are more stable compared to linking, our idea is to exploit extracted from the question to support linking.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach, based on DBpedia entities, for computing relation candidates.
We have empirically evaluated We approach on different standard benchmarks.
We evaluation shows that We approach significantly outperforms existing baseline systems in both recall, precision and runtime.
