Knowledge graphs have become ubiquitous data Knowledge graphs utility has been amplified by the research on ability to answer carefully crafted questions over knowledge graphs.
Knowledge graphs have become ubiquitous data sources utility has been amplified by the research on ability to answer carefully crafted questions over knowledge graphs.
We investigate the problem of question generation over knowledge graphs wherein, the level of difficulty of the question can be controlled.
We present an end-to-end neural network-based method for automatic generation of complex multi-hop questions over knowledge graphs.
Taking an answer as input, We transformer-based model generates a natural language question.
Taking a subgraph as input, We transformer-based model generates a natural language question.
our transformer-based model incorporates difficulty estimation based on named entity popularity.
our transformer-based model makes use of this estimation to generate difficulty-controllable questions.
We evaluate our transformer-based model on two recent multi-hop QA datasets.
We evaluation shows that our transformer-based model is able to generate high-quality questions.
We evaluation shows that our transformer-based model is able to generate fluent questions.
We evaluation shows that our transformer-based model is able to generate relevant questions.
We have released We curated question generation dataset at https://github.com/liyuanfang/mhqg.
