Non-goal oriented, generative dialogue systems lack the ability to generate answers with grounded facts.
A knowledge graph can be considered an abstraction of consisting of well-grounded facts.
This paper addresses the problem of generating well-grounded responses by integrating knowledge graphs into the dialogue system's response generation process, in an end-to-end manner.
A dataset for non-goal oriented dialogues is proposed in This paper in the domain of soccer, conversing on national teams along with a knowledge graph for each of different clubs.

A novel neural network architecture is also proposed as a baseline on this dataset, which can integrate knowledge graphs into the response generation process, producing well articulated, knowledge grounded responses.
Empirical evidence suggests that the proposed model performs better than other state-of-the-art models for integrated dialogue systems.
