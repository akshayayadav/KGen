Several centralised RDF systems support datalog reasoning by precomputing and storing all logically implied triples using the well-known seminaïve algorithm. Large RDF datasets often exceed the capacity of centralised RDF systems, and a common solution is to distribute the datasets in a cluster of shared-nothing servers. While numerous distributed query answering techniques are known, distributed seminaïve evaluation of arbitrary datalog rules is less understood. In fact, most distributed RDF stores either support no reasoning or can handle only limited datalog fragments. In this paper, we extend the dynamic data exchange approach for distributed query answering by Potter et al. [13] to a reasoning algorithm that can handle arbitrary rules while preserving important properties such as nonrepetition of inferences. We also show empirically that our algorithm scales well to very large RDF datasets.
