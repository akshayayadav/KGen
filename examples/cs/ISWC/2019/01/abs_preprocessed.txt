Several centralised RDF systems support datalog reasoning by storing using the well-known seminaïve algorithm.
Several centralised RDF systems support datalog reasoning by precomputing using the well-known seminaïve algorithm.
Large RDF datasets often exceed the capacity of centralised RDF systems, and a common solution is to distribute Large RDF datasets in a cluster of shared-nothing servers.
While distributed query answering techniques are known, distributed seminaïve evaluation of arbitrary datalog rules is less understood.
In fact, most can handle only limited datalog fragments.
In fact, most distributed RDF stores.
In fact, most can handle only limited datalog fragments.
In fact, most distributed support no reasoning.
In this paper, we extend the dynamic data exchange approach for distributed query answering by Potter et al. -LSB- 13 -RSB- to a reasoning algorithm that can handle arbitrary rules while preserving important properties such as nonrepetition of inferences.
we also show empirically that we algorithm scales well to very large RDF datasets.
