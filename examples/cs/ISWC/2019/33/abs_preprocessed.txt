Conjunctive query answering is an important reasoning task for logic-based knowledge representation formalisms, such as Description Logics, to query for instance data that is related in certain ways.
Although many knowledge bases use language features of more expressive Description Logics, there are hardly any systems that support full conjunctive query answering for more expressive Description Logics.
In fact, existing systems usually impose restrictions on the queries.
In fact, existing systems compute incomplete results.
