Starting from the general framework for Annotated RDFS which we presented in previous work ( extending Udrea et al’s Annotated RDF ), we address the development of several features of SPARQL 1.1.

We demonstrate the value of such a framework by comparing We approach to previously proposed extensions of SPARQL.
We demonstrate the value of such a framework by comparing We show that AnQL generalises and extends them.
