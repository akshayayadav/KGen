Starting from the general framework for Annotated RDFS which we presented in previous work (extending Udrea et al’s Annotated RDF), we address the development of a query language – AnQL – that is inspired by SPARQL, including several features of SPARQL 1.1. As a side effect we propose formal definitions of the semantics of these features (subqueries, aggregates, assignment, solution modifiers) which could serve as a basis for the ongoing work in SPARQL 1.1. We demonstrate the value of such a framework by comparing our approach to previously proposed extensions of SPARQL and show that AnQL generalises and extends them.
