Ontologies are often collaboratively developed.
Ontologies are used for sharing information.
different applications and domains resulting in multiple versions of an ontology.
an ontology that are caused by refactorings.
Ontologies are adapted for different applications and domains.
an ontology that are caused by changes.

While there is existing work on detecting structural changes in ontologies, there is still a need in recognizing ontology changes and refactorings by a semantically comparison of ontology versions.

OWL ontologies using DL reasoning to recognize such refactorings.
In our approach, our start with a classification of model refactorings found in software engineering for identifying such refactorings in OWL ontologies.
