The availability of streaming data sources is progressively increasing thanks to the development of ubiquitous data capturing technologies such as sensor networks. The heterogeneity of these sources introduces the requirement of providing data access in a unified and coherent manner, whilst allowing the user to express their needs at an ontological level. In this paper we describe an ontology-based streaming data access service. Sources link their data content to ontologies through s 2o mappings. Users can query the ontology using sparql Stream, an extension of sparql for streaming data. A preliminary implementation of the approach is also presented. With this proposal we expect to set the basis for future efforts in ontology-based streaming data integration.
