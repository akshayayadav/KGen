We extend the Semantic Web query language SPARQL by defining the semantics of SPARQL queries under the entailment regimes of RDF, RDFS, and OWL. The proposed extensions are part of the SPARQL 1.1 Entailment Regimes working draft which is currently being developed as part of the W3C standardization process of SPARQL 1.1. We review the conditions that SPARQL imposes on such extensions, discuss the practical difficulties of this task, and explicate the design choices underlying our proposals. In addition, we include an overview of current implementations and their underlying techniques.
