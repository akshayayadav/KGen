The proliferation of linked data on the Web paves the way to a new generation of applications.
applications that exploit heterogeneous data from different sources.
However, because the Web is continuously evolving it is non-trivial to express some given information needs as structured queries against the relevant link data sources.
However, because the Web is large it is non-trivial to express some given information needs as structured queries against the relevant link data sources.

However, because the Web is large it is non-trivial to identify the relevant link data sources.
In this work, we allow users to express needs in terms of simple keywords.
keyword query routing.
Given simple keywords, we define the problem of finding the relevant sources as the one of keyword query.
As a solution, we present a family of The proposed models.
The proposed models capture information at different levels, representing summaries of varying granularity.
The proposed models represent different trade-offs between efficiency.
The proposed models represent different trade-offs between effectiveness.
We also, verify these trade-offs in experiments carried out in a real-world setting using more than 150 publicly available datasets.
We provide a theoretical analysis of these trade-offs carried out in a real-world setting using more than 150 publicly available datasets.
