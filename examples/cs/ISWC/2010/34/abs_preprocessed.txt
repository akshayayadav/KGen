OWL 2 currently support only static ontologies.
In practice.
Semantic Web applications often need to represent such changes and reason about Semantic Web applications.
however, the truth of statements often changes with time.
In this paper we present a logic-based approach for representing validity time in OWL.
In this paper we present a logic-based approach for representing validity time in RDF.
Unlike the existing proposals, we approach is applicable to entailment relations such as the Direct Semantics.
Unlike the existing proposals, we approach is applicable to entailment relations such as the RDF-Based Semantics of OWL 2.
entailment relations that are not deterministic.
we also extend SPARQL to temporal RDF graphs.
we also present a query evaluation algorithm.
entailment relations characterized by a set of such RDF.
we algorithm that is applicable to entailment relations.
Finally, we present an optimization of we algorithm.
entailment relations characterized by a set of OWL 2 RLRDF entailment.
entailment relations characterized by a set of deterministic rules.
