information originating from heterogeneous sources with the goal of ascertaining trust in various pieces of information.

While previous work has focused on simple models for rating systems, we introduce a new trust model for complex information.We present the challenges raised by the new model, and the results of an evaluation of the first prototype implementation under a variety of scenarios.
While previous work has focused on simple models for review systems, we introduce a new trust model for rich information.We present the challenges raised by the new model, and the results of an evaluation of the first prototype implementation under a variety of scenarios.
While previous work has focused on simple models for review systems, we introduce a new trust model for uncertain information.We present the challenges raised by the new model, and the results of an evaluation of the first prototype implementation under a variety of scenarios.
