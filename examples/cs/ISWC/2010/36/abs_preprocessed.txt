Ontologies underpin the semantic web.
Ontologies define relationships contained in a data source.
Ontologies define the concepts contained in a data source.
An increasing number of ontologies are available online.
an ontology can grow extremely large.
an ontology that combines information from many different sources.
As an ontology grows larger, more resources are required to use an ontology.
an ontology response time becomes slower.
Thus, we evaluate an online approach in terms of time.
an OWL ontology that are no longer used.
Thus, we evaluate an online approach in terms of resources.
an online approach that are cheap to relearn.
an OWL ontology that are infrequently used.
Thus, we present an online approach in terms of time.
Thus, we present an online approach in terms of resources.
RoboCup OWLRescue which is an extension of the widely used RoboCup Rescue.
In order to evaluate our approach, our situate an ontology in a controlled simulation environment, RoboCup OWLRescue platform agents are required to perform.
platform which enables agents to build ontologies automatically based on the tasks.
