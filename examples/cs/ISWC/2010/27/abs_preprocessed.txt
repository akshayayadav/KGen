OWL 2 RL was standardized as a less scalable subset of OWL 2.
OWL 2 RL was standardized as a less expressive subset of OWL 2.
OWL 2 that allows a forward-chaining implementation.
building an enterprise-scale forward-chaining that can 1 ) take advantage of modern multi-core computer architectures.
an enterprise-scale forward-chaining based inference engine.
However.
2 ) efficiently update inference for additions remains a challenge.
In this paper, we present an OWL 2 RL inference engine implemented inside the Oracle database system, using novel techniques for parallel processing.
parallel processing that can readily scale on multi-core machines and clusters.
Additionally, we have added support for efficient incremental maintenance of the inferred graph after triple additions.
Finally, to handle the increasing number of owl , we have provided a hybrid in-memorydisk.
a hybrid in-memorydisk based approach to efficiently compute compact equivalence closures.
Finally, to handle sameAs relationships present in Semantic Web datasets, we have provided a hybrid in-memorydisk.
we have done extensive testing to evaluate these new techniques; the test results demonstrate that we inference engine is capable of performing efficient inference over ontologies with billions of triples.
