DLs ) provide fresh motivations for extending DLs with nonmonotonic inferences— a topic.
Biomedical ontologies provide fresh motivations for extending DLs with nonmonotonic inferences— a topic.
Despite this, nonmonotonic inferences are not yet supported by the existing DL engines.
One reason is the high computational complexity of the existing decidable fragments of nonmonotonic DLs.
