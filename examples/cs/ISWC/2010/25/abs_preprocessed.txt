applications based on Linked Open Data.
However, the development of applications faces difficulties due to the fact that the different Linked Open Data datasets are rather loosely connected pieces of information.
schema-level information is being ignored.
links between Linked Open Data datasets are almost exclusively on the level of instances.
In particular.
In this paper, we therefore present a system for finding schema-level links between Linked Open Data datasets in the sense of ontology alignment.
Our system called BLOOMS.
Our system is based on the idea of bootstrapping information already present on the Linked Open Data cloud.
present a comprehensive evaluation which shows that BLOOMS outperforms state-of-the-art ontology alignment systems on Linked Open Data datasets.
Our also present a comprehensive evaluation.
At the same time, BLOOMS is also competitive compared with these other systems on the Ontology Evaluation Alignment Initiative Benchmark datasets.
