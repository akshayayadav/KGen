Facilitating the seamless evolution of RDF knowledge bases on the Semantic Web presents still a major challenge.
In this work we devise EvoPatâ€“ a pattern-based approach for the evolution and refactoring of knowledge bases.
basic evolution patterns which are represented declaratively.
basic evolution patterns which can capture refactoring operations on both data.
basic evolution patterns which can capture simple evolution on both schema levels.
basic evolution patterns which can capture simple evolution on both data.
a pattern-based approach for the evolution and refactoring of knowledge bases is based on the definition of basic evolution patterns.
basic evolution patterns which can capture refactoring operations on both schema levels.
For refactorings several simple evolution patterns can be combined into a compound one.
For more advanced several simple evolution patterns can be combined into a compound one.
For domain-specific evolution several simple evolution patterns can be combined into a compound one.
We performed a comprehensive survey of possible evolution patterns with a combinatorial analysis of all possible beforeafter combinations, resulting in an extensive catalog of usable evolution patterns.
We approach was implemented as an extension for framework.
We approach was implemented as an extension for the OntoWiki semantic collaboration platform.
