We combine regular path queries with query approximation in order to support flexible querying of RDF data when the user's lacks knowledge of the user's full structure.
We combine regular path queries with query approximation in order to support flexible querying of RDF data where its full structure is irregular.
We develop query relaxation techniques for regular path queries.
In such circumstances, it is helpful if the querying system can perform both approximate matching and relaxation of the userâ€™s query and can rank the answers according to how closely the user's match the original query.
approximation based on RDFS-based inference rules.
approximation based on edit distance.
Our framework incorporates both standard notions of approximation.
querying paths using regular expressions.
The query language we adopt comprises conjunctions of regular path queries, thus including extensions.
extensions proposed for SPARQL to allow for querying paths.
We provide an incremental query evaluation algorithm.
an incremental query evaluation algorithm which runs in returns answers to the user's in ranked order.
an incremental query evaluation algorithm which runs in polynomial time to the user's in ranked order.
