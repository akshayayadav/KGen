We develop query relaxation techniques for regular path queries and combine them with query approximation in order to support flexible querying of RDF data when the user lacks knowledge of its full structure or where the structure is irregular. In such circumstances, it is helpful if the querying system can perform both approximate matching and relaxation of the userâ€™s query and can rank the answers according to how closely they match the original query. Our framework incorporates both standard notions of approximation based on edit distance and RDFS-based inference rules. The query language we adopt comprises conjunctions of regular path queries, thus including extensions proposed for SPARQL to allow for querying paths using regular expressions. We provide an incremental query evaluation algorithm which runs in polynomial time and returns answers to the user in ranked order.
