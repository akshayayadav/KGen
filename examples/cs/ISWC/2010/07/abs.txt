We study the problem of evolution for Knowledge Bases (KBs) expressed in Description Logics (DLs) of the DL − Lite family. DL − Lite is at the basis of OWL 2 QL, one of the tractable fragments of OWL 2, the recently proposed revision of the Web Ontology Language. We propose some fundamental principles that KB evolution should respect. We review known model and formula-based approaches for evolution of propositional theories. We exhibit limitations of a number of model-based approaches: besides the fact that they are either not expressible in DL − Lite or hard to compute, they intrinsically ignore the structural properties of KBs, which leads to undesired properties of KBs resulting from such an evolution. We also examine proposals on update and revision of DL KBs that adopt the model-based approaches and discuss their drawbacks. We show that known formula-based approaches are also not appropriate for DL − Lite evolution, either due to high complexity of computation, or because the result of such an action of evolution is not expressible in DL − Lite. Building upon the insights gained, we propose two novel formula-based approaches that respect our principles and for which evolution is expressible in DL − Lite. For our approaches we also developed polynomial time algorithms to compute evolution of DL − Lite KBs.
