Recently, processing of queries on linked data has gained attention.
We identify.
a top-down strategy that relies on complete knowledge about new sources to select relevant sources.
a bottom-up strategy that discovers new sources during query processing by following links between sources.
We systematically discuss three main strategies: a top-down strategy.
a mixed strategy that assumes some incomplete knowledge.
a mixed strategy that discovers new sources at run-time.
a top-down strategy that relies on complete knowledge about new sources to process relevant sources.
We systematically discuss three main strategies: a mixed strategy.
We systematically discuss three main strategies: a bottom-up strategy.
To exploit knowledge we propose an additional step, explicitly scheduled during query processing, called correct source ranking.
knowledge discovered at run-time.
Additionally, we propose the adoption of stream-based query processing to deal with the unpredictable nature of data access in the distributed Linked Data environment.
In experiments, we show that our implementation of the mixed strategy leads to early reporting of results and thus, more responsive query processing, while not requiring complete knowledge.
