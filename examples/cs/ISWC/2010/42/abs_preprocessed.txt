Policies are declarations of constraints on the behaviour of components within distributed systems, and are often used to capture norms within agent-based systems.
A few machine-processable representations for policies have been proposed.
policies that can be limited by the complexity of associated reasoning mechanisms.
A few machine-processable representations for policies tend to be either limited in the types of policies.
policies that can be expressed by the complexity of associated reasoning mechanisms.
In this paper, we argue for a language which enables both policy analysis within the bounds of decidability.
In this paper, we argue for a language which enables both policy-governed decision-making within the bounds of decidability.
In this paper, we argue for a language that sufficiently expresses the types of policies essential in practical systems.
policies that meets these criteria.
a reasoning mechanism that uses a novel combination of query answering.
a reasoning mechanism that uses a novel combination of ontology consistency checking.
We then propose an OWL-based representation of policies.
these criteria using.
We then propose an OWL-based representation of a reasoning mechanism.
In this way, agent-based systems can be effectively in policy-constrainted environments.
In this way, agent-based systems can be developed that operate flexibly.
