The sparse data have caused widespread attention to Knowledge Representation Learning ( KRL ) technology.
large computational overhead in the use of large-scale knowledge graphs have caused widespread attention to Knowledge Representation Learning ( KRL ) technology.
Although many KRL models have been proposed to embed structure information, many KRL models ability to accurately represent newly added entities is significantly insufficient.
Although many KRL models have been proposed to embed structure information, many KRL models ability to accurately represent entities with few relations is significantly insufficient.
In some studies, the introduction of textual information has partially solved this problem.
However, most existing text-enhanced models ignore the relation mention information between deep semantic information between sentences.

However, most existing text-enhanced models only consider the shallow description information of the entities.
