The RDF-to-text task has recently gained substantial attention due to continuous growth of Linked Data.
In contrast to traditional pipeline models, recent studies have focused on neural models.
neural models which are now able to convert a set of RDF triples into text in an end-to-end style with promising results.
However, English is the only language widely targeted.

a multilingual graph-based neural model that verbalizes RDF data to English.
We address this research gap by presenting NABU, a multilingual graph-based neural model.
a multilingual graph-based neural model that verbalizes RDF data to Russian.
NABU, a multilingual graph-based neural model uses an encoder.
a multilingual graph-based neural model that verbalizes RDF data to German, Russian.
an encoder inspired by a Transformer as decoder.
a multilingual graph-based neural model that verbalizes RDF data to English is based on an encoder-decoder architecture.
an encoder inspired by Graph Attention Networks as decoder.
We approach relies on the fact that knowledge graphs are language-agnostic.
knowledge graphs hence can be used to generate multilingual text.
We evaluate NABU in monolingual settings on standard benchmarking WebNLG datasets.
We evaluate NABU in multilingual settings on standard benchmarking WebNLG datasets.

We results show that NABU, a multilingual graph-based neural model achieves consistent results across all languages on the multilingual scenario with 56.04 BLEU.
a multilingual graph-based neural model that verbalizes RDF data to English.
We results show that NABU, a multilingual graph-based neural model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on English with 66.21 BLEU.
