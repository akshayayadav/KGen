Question Answering systems are generally modelled as a pipeline.
a pipeline consisting of a sequence of steps.
In such a pipeline, Entity Linking is often the first step.
Several Entity perform entity disambiguation.
Several Entity perform span detection.
Several Entity Linking models first.
result in a drop of overall accuracy.
In such models errors from the span detection phase cascade to later steps.
Moreover, lack of gold entity spans in training data is a limiting factor for span detector training.
Hence the movement towards end-to-end Entity Linking models began where no separate span detection step is involved.
the popular Pointer Network model which achieves competitive performance.
In this work we present a novel approach to end-to-end Entity Linking by applying the popular Pointer Network model.
we demonstrate this in we evaluation over three datasets on the Wikidata Knowledge Graph.
