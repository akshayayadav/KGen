Keyword search has been a prominent approach to querying knowledge graphs.
For exploratory search tasks, existing methods commonly extract subgraphs.
subgraphs that are group Steiner trees as answers.
However, a group Steiner tree may inevitably have a large graph structure in contrast to users’ favor to a compact answer.
However, a group Steiner tree may inevitably have a unfocused graph structure in contrast to users’ favor to a compact answer.
However, a group Steiner tree may not exist.
a group Steiner tree that connects all the query keywords.
Therefore.
in this paper, we aim at generating relaxable subgraphs as answers.
we allow a computed subgraph to only connect an incomplete subset of query keywords.
we require a computed subgraph to have a.
a bounded diameter.
in this paper, we aim at generating compact subgraphs as answers.
We formulate a computed subgraph as a new combinatorial optimization problem of computing a minimally relaxed answer with a compactness guarantee.
we present a novel best-first search algorithm.
Extensive experiments showed that We approach efficiently computed compact answers of high completeness.
