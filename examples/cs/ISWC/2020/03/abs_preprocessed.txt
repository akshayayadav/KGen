The number and size of RDF knowledge graphs grows continuously.
Efficient storage solutions for these graphs are indispensable for these graphs use in real applications.
We present such a storage solution.
a storage solution dubbed Tentris.
a novel data structure which we dub hypertrie.
We solution represents RDF knowledge graphs as sparse order-3 tensors.
sparse order-3 tensors using a novel data structure.
a novel data structure which we dub hypertrie.
a novel data structure then uses tensor algebra to carry out SPARQL queries by mapping SPARQL operations to Einstein summation.
By being able to compute Einstein summations efficiently, Tentris outperforms the commercial RDF storage solutions evaluated in our experiments by at least 1.8 times with respect to the average number of queries Tentris can serve per second on three datasets of up to 1 billion triples.
