The generation of referring expressions is one of the most extensively explored tasks in natural language generation, where a description is to be provided.
a description that uniquely identifies an instance.
Some recent approaches aim to discover referring expressions in knowledge graphs.
To limit the search space, existing approaches define quality measures based on the intuitiveness and simplicity of the discovered expressions.
