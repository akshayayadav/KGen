We introduce an approach to semantically represent and query raster data in a Semantic Web graph. We extend the GeoSPARQL vocabulary and query language to support raster data as a new type of geospatial data. We define new filter functions and illustrate our approach using several use cases on real-world data sets. Finally, we describe a prototypical implementation and validate the feasibility of our approach.
