Despite their large-scale coverage, cross-domain knowledge graphs invariably suffer from inherent incompleteness and sparsity. Link prediction can alleviate this by inferring a target entity, given a source entity and a query relation. Recent embedding-based approaches operate in an uninterpretable latent semantic vector space of entities and relations, while path-based approaches operate in the symbolic space, making the inference process explainable. However, these approaches typically consider static snapshots of the knowledge graphs, severely restricting their applicability for evolving knowledge graphs with newly emerging entities. To overcome this issue, we propose an inductive representation learning framework that is able to learn representations of previously unseen entities. Our method finds reasoning paths between source and target entities, thereby making the link prediction for unseen entities interpretable and providing support evidence for the inferred link.
