Despite their large-scale coverage large-scale coverage, cross-domain knowledge graphs invariably suffer from inherent incompleteness and sparsity.
Link prediction can alleviate this by inferring a target entity, given a query relation.
Link prediction can alleviate this by inferring a target entity, given a source entity.
Recent embedding-based approaches operate in an uninterpretable latent semantic vector space of entities while path-based approaches operate in the symbolic space, making the inference process explainable.
Recent embedding-based approaches operate in an uninterpretable latent semantic vector space of relations while path-based approaches operate in the symbolic space, making the inference process explainable.
However, path-based approaches typically consider static snapshots of the knowledge graphs, severely restricting path-based approaches applicability for evolving knowledge graphs with newly emerging entities.
an inductive representation learning framework.
framework that is able to learn representations of previously unseen entities.
To overcome this issue, we propose an inductive representation.
Our method finds reasoning paths between target entities, thereby making the link prediction for unseen entities interpretable.
Our method finds reasoning paths between source entities, thereby making the link prediction for unseen entities interpretable.
Our method finds reasoning paths between target entities, thereby providing support evidence for the inferred link.
