We adapt existing approaches for privacy-preserving publishing of linked data to a setting ( formally: existentially quantified ) individuals.
a setting where the data are given as Description Logic ABoxes with possibly anonymised.
the privacy policies are expressed using sets of concepts of the Description Logic EL.
We provide a chacterization of compliance of such ABoxes show how optimal compliant anonymisations of ABoxes can be computed.
ABoxes that are non-compliant.
We provide a chacterization of compliance of such ABoxes w.r.t. EL policies.
privacy-preserving ontology publishing in which a very restricted form of ABoxes, called instance stores, had been considered.
This work extends previous work on privacy-preserving ontology publishing.
This work restricts the attention to compliance.
The approach developed here can easily be adapted to the problem of computing optimal repairs of quantified ABoxes.
