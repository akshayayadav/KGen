Based on Semantic Web technologies, knowledge graphs help users to discover information of interest by using live SPARQL services.
Answer-seekers often examine intermediate results iteratively.
Answer-seekers often modify SPARQL queries repeatedly in a search session.
In this context, understanding user behaviors is critical for effective intention prediction.
In this context, understanding user behaviors is critical for query optimization.
However, user behaviors have not yet been researched systematically at the SPARQL session level.
This paper reveals secrets of session level user search behaviors by conducting a comprehensive investigation over massive real-world SPARQL query logs.
query changes made by users regarding data-driven features of SPARQL queries.
In particular, we thoroughly assess query changes.
query changes made by users regarding structural features of SPARQL queries.
To illustrate the potentiality of we findings, we employ an application example of how to use we findings.
findings which might be valuable to devise relaxation techniques in the future.
findings which might be valuable to devise approximation.
findings which might be valuable to devise query suggestion.
findings which might be valuable to devise efficient SPARQL caching.
findings which might be valuable to devise auto-completion.
