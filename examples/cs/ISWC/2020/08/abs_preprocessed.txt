In recent years, misinformation on the Web has become increasingly rampant.
The research community has responded by proposing challenges.
The research community has responded by proposing systems.
systems which are beginning to be useful for ( various subtasks of ) detecting misinformation.
challenges which are beginning to be useful for ( various subtasks of ) detecting misinformation.
deep learning techniques which are fine-tuned to specific domains, are difficult to produce results.
results which are not machine readable.
deep learning techniques which are fine-tuned to specific domains, are difficult to interpret results.
However, most proposed systems are based on deep learning techniques.
This limits This applicability and adoption as This can only be used by a select expert audience in very specific settings.
Credibility Reviews that can be used to build networks of distributed bots.
In this paper we propose an architecture based on a core concept of Credibility Reviews.
distributed bots that collaborate for misinformation detection.
The Credibility Reviews serve as building blocks to compose graphs of web content, existing credibility signals– reputation reviews of websites–.
The Credibility Reviews serve as building blocks to compose graphs of web content, existing credibility signals– fact-checked claims of websites–.
