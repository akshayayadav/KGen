Language Models (LMs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are both active research areas in Machine Learning and Semantic Web. While LMs have brought great improvements for many downstream tasks on their own, they are often combined with KGs providing additionally aggregated, well structured knowledge. Usually, this is done by leveraging KGs to improve LMs. But what happens if we turn this around and use LMs to improve KGs?
