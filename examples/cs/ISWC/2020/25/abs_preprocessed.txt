Knowledge Graphs are both active research areas in Machine Learning and Semantic Web.
Language Models are both active research areas in Machine Learning and Semantic Web.
While Language Models have brought great improvements for many downstream tasks on Language Models own, Language Models are often combined with Knowledge Graphs.
Knowledge Graphs providing additionally aggregated, well structured knowledge.
Usually, this is done by leveraging Knowledge Graphs to improve Language Models.
But what happens if we turn this around.
