RDF is a recent W3C recommendation language for validating RDF data.
constraints that enforce particular shapes on an RDF graph.
Specifically, SHACL documents are collections of constraints.

a new first-order language called Open image in new window.
In this paper, we undertake a thorough study of the different features of SHACL by providing a translation to a new first-order language.
new window that precisely captures the semantics of SHACL w.r.t. satisfiability.
new window that precisely captures the semantics of containment.
We provide the detailed map of decidability results of the aforementioned decision problems for different SHACL sublanguages.
We study the interaction of SHACL features in this logic.
We provide the detailed map of complexity results of the aforementioned decision problems for different SHACL sublanguages.
Notably, We prove that both problems are undecidable for the full language.
Notably, We prove that We present decidable combinations of interesting features.
