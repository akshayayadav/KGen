Tables in scientific papers contain a wealth of valuable knowledge for the scientific enterprise.
To help the many of us who frequently consult this type of knowledge, we present Tab2Know .
To help the many of us who frequently consult this type of knowledge, we present a new end-to-end system to build a Knowledge Base ( KB ) from tables in scientific papers.
Tab2Know addresses the challenge of automatically interpreting the tables in papers.
Tab2Know addresses of disambiguating the entities that the entities contain.
a pipeline that employs logic-based reasoning.
To solve these problems, we propose a pipeline.
a pipeline that employs both statistical-based classifiers.
First, we pipeline applies weakly supervised classifiers to recognize the type of tables with the help of a data labeling system.
First, we pipeline applies weakly supervised classifiers to recognize the type of tables with an ontology specifically designed for our purpose.
First, we pipeline applies weakly supervised classifiers to recognize the type of columns with the help of a data labeling system.
First, we pipeline applies weakly supervised classifiers to recognize the type of columns with an ontology specifically designed for our purpose.
Then, logic-based reasoning is used to link equivalent entities ( via sameAs links ) in different tables.
An empirical evaluation of our approach has returned satisfactory performance.
our approach using a corpus of papers in the Computer Science domain.
This suggests that our is a promising step to create a large-scale KB of scientific knowledge.
