To alleviate the cold start problem knowledge graphs are increasingly employed by many methods as auxiliary resources.
the cold start problem caused by collaborative filtering in recommender systems.
However, existing work can not capture the explicit long-range semantics between items meanwhile consider various connectivity between items.

However, existing work can not capture the explicit long-range semantics between users meanwhile consider various connectivity between items.
RGRec which combines GNNs ) for recommendation.
RGRec which combines graph neural networks ) for recommendation.
RGRec which combines rule learning ) for recommendation.
In this paper, we propose RGRec.
RGRec first adds users as new entities.
RGRec first maps items to corresponding entities in knowledge graphs.
Then, it automatically learns rules to model the explicit long-range semantics, and captures the connectivity between entities by aggregation to better encode various information.
We show the effectiveness of RGRec on three real-world datasets.
Particularly, the combination of rule learning and GNNs achieves substantial improvement compared to methods only using either of rule learning and GNNs.
