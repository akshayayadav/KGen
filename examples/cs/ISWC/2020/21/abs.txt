To alleviate the cold start problem caused by collaborative filtering in recommender systems, knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly employed by many methods as auxiliary resources. However, existing work incorporated with KGs cannot capture the explicit long-range semantics between users and items meanwhile consider various connectivity between items. In this paper, we propose RGRec, which combines rule learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) for recommendation. RGRec first maps items to corresponding entities in KGs and adds users as new entities. Then, it automatically learns rules to model the explicit long-range semantics, and captures the connectivity between entities by aggregation to better encode various information. We show the effectiveness of RGRec on three real-world datasets. Particularly, the combination of rule learning and GNNs achieves substantial improvement compared to methods only using either of them.
