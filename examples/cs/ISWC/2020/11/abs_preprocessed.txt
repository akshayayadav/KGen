We propose techniques.
attributes selected in the SPARQL query.
an RDFSPARQL setting where similarity in an RDF graph is measured with respect to a set of attributes.
techniques that support the efficient computation of multidimensional similarity joins in an RDFSPARQL setting.
While similarity joins have been studied in other contexts, RDF graphs present unique challenges.
ways in which a similarity can be implemented.
We discuss how a similarity join operator can investigate ways.
ways in which a similarity can be optimised.
We discuss how a similarity join operator can be included in the SPARQL language.
We devise experiments to compare three similarity join algorithms over two datasets.
We results reveal that We techniques outperform DBSimJoin: a PostgreSQL extension joins.
a PostgreSQL extension that supports similarity.
