Clustering entities over knowledge graphs (KGs) is an asset for explorative search and knowledge discovery. KG embeddings have been intensively investigated, mostly for KG completion, and have potential also for entity clustering. However, embeddings are latent and do not convey user-interpretable labels for clusters. This work presents ExCut, a novel approach that combines KG embeddings with rule mining methods, to compute informative clusters of entities along with comprehensible explanations. The explanations are in the form of concise combinations of entity relations. ExCut jointly enhances the quality of entity clusters and their explanations, in an iterative manner that interleaves the learning of embeddings and rules. Experiments on real-world KGs demonstrate the effectiveness of ExCut for discovering high-quality clusters and their explanations.
