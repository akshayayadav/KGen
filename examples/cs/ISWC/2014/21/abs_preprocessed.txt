Matrix Factorisation is a recommendation approach.
a user based on Matrix Factorisation past ratings for products, movies, songs ).
a recommendation approach that tries to understand what factors interest then use this factor information to predict future item ratings.
a user based on Matrix Factorisation past ratings for items ).
a recommendation approach that tries to understand what factors interest a user use this factor information to predict future item ratings.
A central limitation of this approach however is that this approach can not capture how a user’s tastes have evolved beforehand; thereby ignoring if a user’s preference for a factor is likely to change.
One solution to this is to include users’ preferences for semantic ) categories, however this approach is limited should a user be presented with an item so called cold-start categories.
One solution to this is to include users’ preferences for i.e. ) categories, however this approach is limited should a user be presented with an item so called cold-start categories.
an item for which Matrix Factorisation has not rated the semantic categories previously.
i.e. linked data.
In this paper we present a method to overcome this limitation by transferring rated semantic categories in place of unrated categories through the use of vertex kernels.
In this paper we present a method to overcome this limitation by transferring incorporate this into our prior SemanticSVD model.
empirically demonstrate the superior performance that our achieve over: existing SVD models.
our several vertex kernels effects on recommendation error.
empirically demonstrate the superior performance that our achieve over: existing SemanticSVD with no transferred semantic categories.
