A considerable portion of the information on the Web is still only available in unstructured form. Implementing the vision of the Semantic Web thus requires transforming this unstructured data into structured data. One key step during this process is the recognition of named entities. Previous works suggest that ensemble learning can be used to improve the performance of named entity recognition tools. However, no comparison of the performance of existing supervised machine learning approaches on this task has been presented so far. We address this research gap by presenting a thorough evaluation of named entity recognition based on ensemble learning. To this end, we combine four different state-of-the approaches by using 15 different algorithms for ensemble learning and evaluate their performace on five different datasets. Our results suggest that ensemble learning can reduce the error rate of state-of-the-art named entity recognition systems by 40
