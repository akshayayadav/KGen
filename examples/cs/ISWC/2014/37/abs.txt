We present a description and analysis of the data access challenge in the Siemens Energy. We advocate for Ontology Based Data Access (OBDA) as a suitable Semantic Web driven technology to address the challenge. We derive requirements for applying OBDA in Siemens, review existing OBDA systems and discuss their limitations with respect to the Siemens requirements. We then introduce the Optique platform as a suitable OBDA solution for Siemens. Finally, we describe our preliminary installation and evaluation of the platform in Siemens.
