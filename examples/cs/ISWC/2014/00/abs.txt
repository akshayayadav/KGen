Metadata is a vital factor for effective management, organization and retrieval of multimedia content. In this paper, we introduce CAMO, a new system developed jointly with Samsung to enrich multimedia metadata by integrating Linked Open Data (LOD). Large-scale, heterogeneous LOD sources, e.g., DBpedia, LinkMDB and MusicBrainz, are integrated using ontology matching and instance linkage techniques. A mobile app for Android devices is built on top of the LOD to improve multimedia content browsing. An empirical evaluation is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the system in the multimedia domain.
