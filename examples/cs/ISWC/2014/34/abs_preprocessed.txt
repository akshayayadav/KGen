the ontology-based data access platform Ontop that supports answering SPARQL queries under the OWL 2 QL direct semantics entailment regime for data instances.
data instances stored in relational databases.
We present an extension of the ontology-based data access platform Ontop.
On the theoretical side, we show how any input SPARQL query, OWL 2 QL ontology can be rewritten to an equivalent SQL query solely over the data.
On the theoretical side, we show how R2RML mappings can be rewritten to an equivalent SQL query solely over the data.
T-mappings compiling R2RML mappings with ontology hierarchies.
T-mapping optimisations using database integrity constraints.
initial experimental results demonstrating that by applying the Ontop technologiesâ€” the tree-witness query rewriting, T-mappings.
T-mapping optimisations using SQL expressivity.
On the theoretical side.
we present initial experimental results.
T-mapping optimisations the system produces scalable SQL queries.
