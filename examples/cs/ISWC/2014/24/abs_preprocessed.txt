Semantic Web technologies are used in enabling expressive, standards-based reasoning.
Semantic Web technologies are used in a variety of domains for Semantic Web technologies ability to facilitate data integration.
Deploying Semantic Web reasoning processes directly on mobile devices has a number.
Deploying Semantic Web reasoning processes directly on mobile devices reduced infrastructure requirements.
Deploying Semantic Web reasoning processes directly on mobile devices has robustness to connectivity loss, more timely results,.
At the same time, a number of challenges arise as well, related to limited computing resources.
At the same time, a number of challenges arise as well, related to mobile platform heterogeneity.
To tackle these challenges, it should be possible to benchmark mobile reasoning performance across different mobile platforms, with rule.
datasets of complexity flows.
datasets of existing reasoning process flows.
datasets of varying scale flows.
To deal with the current heterogeneity of rule formats.
To deal with the current heterogeneity of a uniform rule.
data-interface on top of mobile reasoning engines should be provided as well.
In this paper, we present a cross-platform benchmark framework.
a cross-platform benchmark framework that supplies 1 ) a generic, standards-based Semantic Web layer on top of existing mobile reasoning engines.
a cross-platform benchmark framework that supplies 2 ) a benchmark engine to investigate mobile reasoning performance.
a cross-platform benchmark framework that supplies 2 ) a benchmark engine to compare mobile reasoning performance.
