Linked Data has grown to become one of the largest available knowledge bases.
Unfortunately, this wealth of data remains inaccessible to those without in-depth knowledge of semantic technologies.
We describe a toolchain enabling users without semantic technology background to explore.
We visually analyse Linked Data.
We demonstrate Linked Data applicability in scenarios.
scenarios involving data from the Linked Open Data Cloud.
research data extracted from scientific publications.
We focus is on the Web-based front-end.
the Web-based front-end consisting of querying tools.
