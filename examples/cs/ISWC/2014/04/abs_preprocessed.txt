Only a small fraction of the information on the Web is represented as Linked Data.
This lack of coverage is partly due to the paradigms followed so far to extract Linked Data.
While converting structured data to RDF is well supported by tools, most approaches to extract RDF from semi-structured data rely on extraction methods.
extraction methods based on ad-hoc solutions.
In this paper, we present a open-source framework for the extraction of RDF from templated websites.
In this paper, we present a holistic framework for the extraction of RDF from templated websites.
we discuss the architecture of the initial implementation of each of a holistic framework for the extraction of RDF components.

In particular, we present a novel wrapper induction technique.
a novel wrapper induction technique that does not require any human supervision to detect the wrappers.
a consistency layer with which the data can be checked for logical consistency.
the data extracted by the wrappers.
a holistic framework for the extraction of RDF also includes a consistency layer.
a open-source framework for the extraction of RDF also includes a consistency layer.
we evaluate the initial version of REX on three different datasets.
we results clearly show the potential of using templated Web pages to extend the Linked Data Cloud.
Moreover, Our results indicate the weaknesses of we current implementations.
