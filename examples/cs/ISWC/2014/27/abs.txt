Updates in RDF stores have recently been standardised in the SPARQL 1.1 Update specification. However, computing entailed answers by ontologies is usually treated orthogonally to updates in triple stores. Even the W3C SPARQL 1.1 Update and SPARQL 1.1 Entailment Regimes specifications explicitly exclude a standard behaviour for entailment regimes other than simple entailment in the context of updates. In this paper, we take a first step to close this gap. We define a fragment of SPARQL basic graph patterns corresponding to DL-Lite and the corresponding SPARQL update language, dealing with updates both of ABox and of TBox statements. We discuss possible semantics along with potential strategies for implementing them. In particular, we treat both, materialised RDF stores, which store all entailed triples explicitly, and reduced RDF Stores, that is, redundancy-free RDF stores that do not store any RDF triples entailed by others already. We have implemented all semantics prototypically on top of an off-the-shelf triple store and present some indications on practical feasibility.
