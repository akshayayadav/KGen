Over the last decades, several billion Web pages have been made available on the Web. The ongoing transition from the current Web of unstructured data to the Web of Data yet requires scalable and accurate approaches for the extraction of structured data in RDF (Resource Description Framework) from these websites. One of the key steps towards extracting RDF from text is the disambiguation of named entities. While several approaches aim to tackle this problem, they still achieve poor accuracy. We address this drawback by presenting AGDISTIS, a novel knowledge-base-agnostic approach for named entity disambiguation. Our approach combines the Hypertext-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm with label expansion strategies and string similarity measures. Based on this combination, AGDISTIS can efficiently detect the correct URIs for a given set of named entities within an input text. We evaluate our approach on eight different datasets against state-of-the-art named entity disambiguation frameworks. Our results indicate that we outperform the state-of-the-art approach by up to 29
