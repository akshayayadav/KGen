Over the last decades, several billion Web pages have been made available on the Web of Data.

One of the key steps towards extracting RDF from text is the disambiguation of named entities.
While several approaches aim to tackle this problem, several approaches still achieve poor accuracy.
We address this drawback by presenting AGDISTIS .
We address this drawback by presenting a novel knowledge-base-agnostic approach for named entity disambiguation.
We approach combines the Hypertext-Induced Topic Search ( HITS ) algorithm with string similarity measures.
We approach combines the Hypertext-Induced Topic Search ( HITS ) algorithm with label expansion strategies.
Based on this combination, AGDISTIS can efficiently detect the correct URIs for a given set of named entities within an input text.
We evaluate We approach on eight different datasets against state-of-the-art named entity disambiguation frameworks.
We results indicate that We outperform the state-of-the-art approach by up to 29.
