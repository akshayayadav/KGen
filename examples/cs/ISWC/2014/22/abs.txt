Outlier detection used for identifying wrong values in data is typically applied to single datasets to search them for values of unexpected behavior. In this work, we instead propose an approach which combines the outcomes of two independent outlier detection runs to get a more reliable result and to also prevent problems arising from natural outliers which are exceptional values in the dataset but nevertheless correct. Linked Data is especially suited for the application of such an idea, since it provides large amounts of data enriched with hierarchical information and also contains explicit links between instances. In a first step, we apply outlier detection methods to the property values extracted from a single repository, using a novel approach for splitting the data into relevant subsets. For the second step, we exploit owl:sameAs links for the instances to get additional property values and perform a second outlier detection on these values. Doing so allows us to confirm or reject the assessment of a wrong value. Experiments on the DBpedia and NELL datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.
