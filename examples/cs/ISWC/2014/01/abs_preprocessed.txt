Links between knowledge bases build the backbone of the Linked Data Web.
In previous works, the combination of the results of time-efficient algorithms through set-theoretical operators has been shown to be very time-efficient for Link Discovery.
However, the further optimization of such link specifications has not been paid much attention to.
We address the issue of further a runtime optimizer for Link Discovery.
further optimizing the runtime of link specifications by presenting Helios'.
Helios' comprises both a rewriter for link specifications.
Helios' comprises both an execution planner for link specifications.
a rewriter is a sequence of fixed-point iterators for algebraic rules.
The planner relies on time-efficient evaluation functions to generate execution plans for link specifications.
17 specifications created by 2180 specifications.
We evaluate Helios on 17 specifications generated automatically.
17 specifications created by human experts.
We evaluation shows that Helios' is up to 300 times faster than a canonical planner.
Moreover, Heliosâ€™ improvements are statistically significant.
