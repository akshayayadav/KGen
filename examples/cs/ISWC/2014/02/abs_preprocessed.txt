Exploiting identity links among RDF resources allows applications to efficiently integrate data.
Keys can be very useful to discover these identity links.
A set of properties is considered as a key.
a key when A set of properties values uniquely identify resources.
However, Keys are usually not available.
The approaches can easily require clean data.
The approaches that attempt to automatically discover keys.
The approaches can easily be overwhelmed by the size of the data.
an approach that discovers keys in RDF data in an efficient way.
We present an approach.
We present SAKey.
the data that are dynamically detected during the process.
To prune the search space, SAKey exploits characteristics of the data.
datasets where erroneous data or duplicates exist.
Furthermore, We approach can discover keys in datasets ( i.e., almost keys ).
our approach has been evaluated on different synthetic.
our approach has been evaluated on real datasets.
The results show both the relevance of almost keys.
The results show both the relevance of the efficiency of discovering almost keys.
