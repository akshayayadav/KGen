Driven by initiatives like Schema.org, the amount of semantically annotated data is expected to grow steadily towards massive scale, requiring cluster-based solutions to query cluster-based solutions.
At the same time, Hadoop has become dominant in the area of Big Data processing with large infrastructures.
large infrastructures being already used in manifold application fields.

many synergy benefits making Hadoop-based very attractive to use these infrastructures for semantic data processing as well.
For Hadoop-based applications, a common data pool provides many synergy benefits.
Indeed, existing SPARQL-on- Hadoop approaches have already demonstrated very good scalability, however, query runtimes are rather slow due to the underlying batch processing framework.
SPARQL queries that are typically much more selective requiring only small subsets of the data.
While this is acceptable for data-intensive queries, it is not satisfactory for the majority of SPARQL queries.
In this paper, we present a SPARQL-over-SQL-on-Hadoop approach.
a SPARQL-over-SQL-on-Hadoop approach designed with selective queries in mind.
In this paper, we present Sempala.
Our evaluation shows performance improvements by an order of magnitude compared to existing approaches, paving the way for interactive-time SPARQL query processing on Hadoop.
