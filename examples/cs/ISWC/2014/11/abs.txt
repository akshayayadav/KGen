As the Web of Data is growing at an ever increasing speed, the lack of reliable query solutions for live public data becomes apparent. sparql implementations have matured and deliver impressive performance for public sparql endpoints, yet poor availability—especially under high loads— prevents their use in real-world applications. We propose to tackle this availability problem by defining triple pattern fragments, a specific kind of Linked Data Fragments that enable low-cost publication of queryable data by moving intelligence from the server to the client. This paper formalizes the Linked Data Fragments concept, introduces a client-side sparql query processing algorithm that uses a dynamic iterator pipeline, and verifies servers’ availability under load. The results indicate that, at the cost of lower performance, query techniques with triple pattern fragments lead to high availability, thereby allowing for reliable applications on top of public, queryable Linked Data.
