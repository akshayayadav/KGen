In this paper we study query answering and rewriting in ontology-based data access. Specifically, we present an algorithm for computing a perfect rewriting of unions of conjunctive queries posed over ontologies expressed in the description logic ELHIO, which covers the OWL 2 QL and OWL 2 EL profiles. The novelty of our algorithm is the use of a set of ABox dependencies, which are compiled into a so-called EBox, to limit the expansion of the rewriting. So far, EBoxes have only been used in query rewriting in the case of DL-Lite, which is less expressive than ELHIO. We have extensively evaluated our new query rewriting technique, and in this paper we discuss the tradeoff between the reduction of the size of the rewriting and the computational cost of our approach.
