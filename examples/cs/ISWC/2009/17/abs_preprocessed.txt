The focus of web search is moving away from returning relevant documents towards returning structured data as results to user queries.
A vital part in the architecture of search engines are link-based ranking algorithms.
link-based ranking algorithms which however are targeted towards hypertext documents.
cases where data exhibits enormous variance in vocabularies.
Existing ranking algorithms for structured data, on the other hand, are thus not applicable in cases.
data integrated from a large number of sources.
vocabularies used.
Existing ranking algorithms for structured data, on the other hand, require manual input of a domain expert.
In such environments, the authority of data sources is an important signal that the ranking algorithm has to take into account.
web datasets expressed in RDF.
prioritising data returned by queries over web datasets.
This paper presents algorithms for prioritising data.
authority which provides a correspondence between these identifiers.
these identifiers which can speak authoritatively for these identifiers.
authority which provides a correspondence between the sources.
We introduce the notion of naming authority.
the sources which can speak authoritatively for these identifiers.
identifiers referenced in the sources.
We uses the original PageRank method to assign authority values to data sources based on a naming authority graph.
We then propagates the authority values to identifiers.
We conduct performance evaluations of the method on a large web dataset.
We conduct quality evaluations of the method on a large web dataset.
the method on a large web dataset has applications in search, query processing, reasoning over integrated datasets.
the method on a large web dataset has applications in user interfaces over integrated datasets.
the method on a large web dataset requires no manual input.
the method on a large web dataset is schema-independent.
