OntoCase is a framework for semi-automatic pattern-based ontology construction.

Applying Content ODPs within semi-automatic ontology construction, i.e. ontology learning, is a novel approach.
ontologies constructed automatically based on ODPs.

We show that it is possible to improve the results of existing ontology learning methods by reusing Content ODPs.
We show that it is possible to improve the results of existing ontology learning methods by selecting Content ODPs.
by exploiting background knowledge the ontology is given a richer overall structure.
OntoCase is able to introduce a general top structure into the ontologies.
