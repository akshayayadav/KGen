RDF Schema as a lightweight ontology language is gaining popularity and, consequently, tools for scalable RDF Schema inference are needed.
RDF Schema as a lightweight ontology language is querying are needed.
SPARQL has become recently a W3C standard for querying RDF data.
SPARQL mostly provides means for querying simple RDF graphs only, whereas querying with respect to RDF Schema is left outside the current specification.
SPARQL mostly provides means for querying simple RDF graphs only, whereas querying with respect to other entailment regimes is left outside the current specification.
we show that SPARQL faces certain unwanted ramifications when querying ontologies in conjunction with RDF datasets.
In this paper.
we provide an extension for SPARQL that remedies these effects.
RDF datasets that comprise multiple named graphs.
Moreover, since RDF Schema inference has a close relationship with logic rules, we generalize our approach to select a custom ruleset for specifying inferences to be taken into account in a SPARQL query.
GiaBATA which uses Datalog coupled with a persistent Relational Database.
RDF Schema querying in our prototype system GiaBATA.
our show that our extensions are technically feasible by providing benchmark results for RDF Schema as a back-end for implementing SPARQL with dynamic rule-based inference.
By employing different optimization techniques like magic set rewriting our system remains competitive with state-of-the-art RDF Schema querying systems.
