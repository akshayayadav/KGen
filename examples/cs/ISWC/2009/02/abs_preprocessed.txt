State-of-the-art discovery of Semantic Web services is based on hybrid algorithms.
hybrid algorithms that combine semantic matchmaking.
hybrid algorithms that combine syntactic matchmaking.
These approaches are purely based on similarity measures between parameters of a service request.
These approaches are available service descriptions, which, however, fail to completely capture the actual functionality of the service.
These approaches are the quality of the results.
the results returned by the service.
On the other hand, with the advent of Web 2.0, active user participation has become an increasingly popular trend.
On the other hand, with the advent of Web 2.0, collaboration has become an increasingly popular trend.
Users often group relevant items, thus providing valuable information improve the accuracy of search results.
valuable information that can be taken into account to further.
Users often rate providing valuable information improve the accuracy of search results.
a method that combines multiple matching criteria with user feedback.
In this paper, we tackle this issue, by proposing a method to further improve the results of the matchmaker.
we describe how user feedback is incorporated in the matchmaking process.
we extend a previously proposed dominance-based approach for service discovery.
we evaluate the performance of we approach using a publicly available collection of OWL-S services.
