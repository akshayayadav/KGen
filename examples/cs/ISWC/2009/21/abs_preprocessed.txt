We present a taxonomy of features, such as privacy.
We present a taxonomy of features, such as security.
We describe a way to compute social trust in OWL-S style semantic Web services.
We formalism exploits the users’ ratings of execution characteristics of OWL-S style semantic Web services.
We formalism exploits the users’ ratings of the services of OWL-S style semantic Web services.
service-composition algorithm called Trusty.
We describe We service-composition algorithm that is based on Our formalism.
We discuss the formal properties of We implementation of our service-composition algorithm, called Trusty, that is based on this formalism.
We discuss the formal properties of Trusty implementation of our service-composition algorithm, called Trusty, that is based on this formalism.
experiments in which We compared Trusty with a well-known AI planning algorithm.
a well-known AI planning algorithm that has been successfully used for OWL-S style service composition.
experiments in which We compared Trusty with SHOP2.
We present We experiments.
We results demonstrate that Trusty generates more trustworthy compositions than SHOP2.
