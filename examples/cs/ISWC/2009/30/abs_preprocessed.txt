The QL profile of OWL 2 has been designed so that it is possible to use database technology for query answering via query rewriting.
the standard algorithm proposed by Calvanese et al.
We resolution based rewriting algorithm with the standard algorithm implementing both.
We present a comparison of We resolution.
We resolution based rewriting algorithm with the standard algorithm conducting an empirical evaluation using ontologies.
ontologies derived from realistic applications.

most cases which could be important for practicality in realistic applications.
The results indicate that our algorithm produces significantly smaller rewritings in most cases.
