RDF is an increasingly important paradigm for the representation of information on the Web.
sophisticated graph matching queries become increasingly important.
As RDF databases increase in size to approach tens of millions of triples scalability becomes an issue.
As RDF databases increase in size as sophisticated graph scalability becomes an issue.
a way that makes the index disk-resident.
To date, there is no graph-based indexing method for RDF data where the index was designed in a way.
indexes that can operate efficiently when the index the index resides on disk.
There is therefore a growing need for indexes.
In this paper, we first propose the DOGMA index for fast subgraph matching on disk.
In this paper, we develop a basic algorithm to answer queries over the index.
algorithm that uses efficient pruning strategies when combined with two different extensions of the index.
a basic algorithm is then significantly sped up via an.
an optimized algorithm.
we have tested a preliminary system against four existing RDF database systems.
we have implemented a preliminary system.
four existing RDF database systems developed by others.
we experiments show that a basic algorithm performs very well compared to four existing RDF database systems.
