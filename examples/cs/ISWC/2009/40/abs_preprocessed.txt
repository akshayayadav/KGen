The Web of Data presents the Silk– Linking Framework, a toolkit for maintaining data links between Web data sources.
The Web of Data presents the Silk– Linking Framework, a toolkit for discovering data links between Web data sources.
Silk consists of 1.
Silk consists of three components .
A link discovery engine which computes links between data sources based on a declarative specification of the conditions that entities must fulfill in order to be interlinked;.
A link discovery engine 2.
A tool for evaluating the 3.
the generated data links in order to fine-tune the linking specification.
A protocol for maintaining data links between continuously changing data sources.
A protocol for maintaining data links between continuously changing data sources.
enables continuous link recomputation.
allows data sources to exchange detailed change information.
allows data sources to exchange both linksets.
The interplay of all the components is demonstrated within a life science use case.
