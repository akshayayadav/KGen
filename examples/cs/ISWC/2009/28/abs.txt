We present a lightweight framework for processing uncertain emergent knowledge that comes from multiple resources with varying relevance. The framework is essentially RDF-compatible, but allows also for direct representation of contextual features (e.g., provenance). We support soft integration and robust querying of the represented content based on well-founded notions of aggregation, similarity and ranking. A proof-of-concept implementation is presented and evaluated within large scale knowledge-based search in life science articles.
