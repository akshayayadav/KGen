Semantic formalisms represent content in a uniform way according to ontologies.
This enables manipulation via automated means ).
This enables manipulation via e.g. Semantic Web services ).
This enables reasoning via e.g. Semantic Web services ).
This limits the userâ€™s ability to explore the semantic data from a point of view.

We show how, for user consumption, a visualization of semantic data according to e.g. time ) provides effective sense-making of data.
We show how, for user consumption, a visualization of semantic data according to e.g. space ) provides effective sense-making of data.
We show how, for user consumption, a visualization of semantic data according to some easily graspable dimensions ) provides effective sense-making of data.
In this paper, we look holistically at the interaction between users.
In this paper, we propose dynamic filters to support the exploration of semantic-rich data.
In this paper, we look holistically at the interaction between semantic data.
In this paper, we propose multiple visualization strategies to support the exploration of semantic-rich data.
We discuss how interaction challenges could be overcome to create an effective user-centred framework for the visualization and manipulation of semantic data.
We discuss a user evaluation.
