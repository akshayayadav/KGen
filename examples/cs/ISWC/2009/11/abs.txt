Social Network Analysis (SNA) provides graph algorithms to characterize the structure of social networks, strategic positions in these networks, specific sub-networks and decompositions of people and activities. Online social platforms like Facebook form huge social networks, enabling people to connect, interact and share their online activities across several social applications. We extended SNA operators using semantic web frameworks to include the semantics of these graph-based representations when analyzing such social networks and to deal with the diversity of their relations and interactions. We present here the results of this approach when it was used to analyze a real social network with 60,000 users connecting, interacting and sharing content.
