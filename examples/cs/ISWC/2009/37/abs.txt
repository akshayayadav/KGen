To direct automated Web service composition, it is compelling to provide a template, workflow or scaffolding that dictates the ways in which services can be composed. In this paper we present an approach to Web service composition that builds on work using AI planning, and more specifically Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs), for Web service composition. A significant advantage of our approach is that it provides much of the how-to knowledge of a choreography while enabling customization and optimization of integrated Web service selection and composition based upon the needs of the specific problem, the preferences of the customer, and the available services. Many customers must also be concerned with enforcement of regulations, perhaps in the form of corporate policies and/or government regulations. Regulations are traditionally enforced at design time by verifying that a workflow or composition adheres to regulations. Our approach supports customization, optimization and regulation enforcement all at composition construction time. To maximize efficiency, we have developed novel search heuristics together with a branch and bound search algorithm that enable the generation of high quality compositions with the performance of state-of-the-art planning systems.
