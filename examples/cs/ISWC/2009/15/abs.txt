Process modeling is a core task in software engineering in general and in web service modeling in particular. The explicit management of process models for purposes such as process selection and/or process reuse requires flexible and intelligent retrieval of process structures based on process entities and relationships, i.e. process activities, hierarchical relationship between activities and their parts, temporal relationships between activities, conditions on process flows as well as the modeling of domain knowledge. In this paper, we analyze requirements for modeling and querying of process models and present a pattern-oriented approach exploiting OWL-DL representation and reasoning capabilities for expressive process modeling and retrieval.
