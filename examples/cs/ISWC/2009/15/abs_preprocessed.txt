Process modeling is a core task in software engineering in general.
Process modeling is a core task in web service modeling in particular.
process structures based on process entities i.e. process activities, hierarchical relationship between activities and activities parts, temporal relationships between activities, conditions on process.

the modeling of domain knowledge.
The explicit management of process models for purposes such as process selection andor process reuse requires flexible retrieval of process structures flows.
The explicit management of process models for purposes such as process selection andor process reuse requires intelligent retrieval of process structures flows.
In this paper, we present a pattern-oriented approach exploiting OWL-DL representation for expressive process modeling and retrieval.
In this paper, we analyze requirements for modeling of process models.
In this paper, we analyze requirements for querying of process models.
In this paper, we present a pattern-oriented approach exploiting reasoning capabilities for expressive process modeling and retrieval.
