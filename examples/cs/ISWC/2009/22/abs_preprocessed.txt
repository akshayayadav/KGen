In this paper a novel approach is presented for generating RDF graphs of arbitrary complexity from various spreadsheet layouts.
Currently, none of the available spreadsheet-to-RDF wrappers supports cross tables and tables where data is not aligned in rows.
Similar to RDF123, XLWrap is based on template graphs where fragments of triples can be mapped to specific cells of a spreadsheet.

The set of available expression functions can be easily extended by users of XLWrap.
The set of available expression functions includes most of the native functions of OpenOffice Calc.
