Nowadays, search on the Web goes beyond the retrieval of textual Web sites.
Nowadays, search on the Web increasingly takes advantage of the growing amount of structured data.
entity search where the units of retrieval are structured These entities.
Of particular interest is entity search.
These entities reside in different sources.
These entities are therefore called “ uncooperative ”.
different sources which may provide only limited information about These entities content.
Further, different sources, which may provide only limited information about their content capture complementary but also redundant information about entities.
federated entity search where redundant information about entities is reduced on-the-fly through entity consolidation.
entity consolidation performed at query time.
In this environment of uncooperative data sources, we study the problem of federated entity search.
We propose a novel method for entity consolidation.
state-of-the-art methods that require training data.
entity consolidation that is based on using language models hence more suitable for this on-the-fly uncooperative setting than state-of-the-art methods.
entity consolidation that is completely unsupervised hence more suitable for this on-the-fly uncooperative setting than state-of-the-art methods.
Further, we apply the same language model technique to deal with the federated search problem of ranking results returned from different sources.
Particular novel are the mechanisms we propose to incorporate consolidation results into this ranking.
experiments using data sources.
experiments using real Web queries.
We perform experiments.
We experiments show that We approach for federated entity search with on-the-fly consolidation improves upon the performance of a state-of-the-art preference aggregation baseline and also benefits from consolidation.
