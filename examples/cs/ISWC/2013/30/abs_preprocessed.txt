DBpedia is a large-scale knowledge base.
a large-scale knowledge base that exploits Wikipedia as primary data source.
The extraction procedure requires to manually map Wikipedia infoboxes into the DBpedia ontology.
Thanks to a large number of infoboxes has been mapped in the English DBpedia.
Thanks to crowdsourcing has been mapped in the English DBpedia.
Consequently, the same procedure has been applied to other languages to create the localized versions of DBpedia.
However, the number of accomplished mappings is still limited to most frequent infoboxes.
However, the number of accomplished mappings is still small to most frequent infoboxes.
Furthermore, mappings need maintenance due to the quick changes of Wikipedia articles.
Furthermore, mappings need maintenance due to the constant changes of Wikipedia articles.
In this paper, we focus on the problem of automatically mapping infobox attributes to properties into the DBpedia ontology for extending the coverage of building from scratch versions for languages not covered in the current version.
In this paper, we focus on the problem of automatically mapping infobox attributes to properties into the DBpedia ontology for extending the coverage of the existing localized versions.
The evaluation has been performed on the Italian mappings.
we compared we results with the current mappings on a random sample re-annotated by the authors.
we approach leads to a significant improvement in speed.
the ones obtained by a human annotator in term of precision.
we report results comparable to the ones.
we approach leads to a significant improvement in recall.
14 different languages for which mappings were not yet available.
Specifically, we mapped 45,978 Wikipedia infobox attributes to DBpedia properties in 14 different languages.
The resource is made available in an open format.
