Research effort in ontology visualization has largely focused on developing new visualization techniques.
At the same time, researchers have paid less attention to investigating the usability of common visualization techniques that many practitioners regularly use to visualize ontological data.
In this paper, we focus on two popular ontology visualization techniques: indented tree.
In this paper, we focus on two popular ontology visualization techniques: graph.
we conduct a controlled usability study with an emphasis on the effectiveness, efficiency, workload and satisfaction of two popular ontology visualization techniques: indented tree and graph in the context of assisting users during evaluation of ontology mappings.
Findings from a controlled usability study with an emphasis on the effectiveness, efficiency, workload and satisfaction of these visualization techniques have revealed both strengths and weaknesses of each visualization technique.
