a task that is notorious for Ontology engineering difficulty.
Ontology engineering is a task.
As the group we are keenly aware of how difficult the users perceive this task to be.
the group that developed the most widely used ontology editor.
the group that developed Protégé.
a tool that will be easy to use while still accounting for commonly used OWL constructs; support collaboration around distributed ontology editing as part of the core tool design.
In this paper, we present the new version of WebProtégé that we designed with two main goals in mind: create a tool.
a tool that will be easy to use while still accounting for commonly used OWL constructs; social interaction around distributed ontology editing as part of the core tool design.
we designed this new version of the WebProtégé user interface empirically, by analysing the use of OWL constructs in a large corpus of publicly available ontologies.
Since the beta release of this new WebProtégé interface in January 2013, we users from around the world have uploaded 519 ontologies on we server.
Since the beta release of this new WebProtégé interface in January 2013, we users from around the world have created 519 ontologies on we server.
we describe the key features of the new tool.
In this paper.
we empirical design approach.
the OWL constructs that are present in ontologies that users have uploaded to WebProtégé.
we evaluate language coverage in WebProtégé by assessing how well WebProtégé covers the OWL constructs.
we evaluate the usability of WebProtégé through a usability survey.
we analysis validates we empirical design, suggests additional language constructors to explore.
we analysis validates we empirical design, demonstrates that an easy-to-use web-based tool is sufficient for many users to start editing many users ontologies.
an easy-to-use web-based tool that covers most of the frequently used OWL constructs.
