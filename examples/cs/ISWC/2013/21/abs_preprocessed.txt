extending large repositories of formalized knowledge.
Web-scale relation extraction is a means for building.
precision which is hard to achieve with automatically acquired rule sets.
This type of automated knowledge building requires a decent level of precision learned from unlabeled data by means of minimal supervision.
This type of automated knowledge building requires a decent level of precision learned from unlabeled data by means of distant supervision.
effective semantic rule filtering.
This paper shows how precision of relation extraction can be considerably improved by employing a wide-coverage for effective semantic rule.
This paper shows how precision of relation extraction can be considerably improved by employing BabelNet for effective semantic rule.
This paper shows how precision of relation extraction can be considerably improved by employing general-purpose lexical semantic network for effective semantic rule.
We apply Word Sense Disambiguation to the content words of the automatically extracted rules.
As a result a set of relation-specific relevant concepts is obtained.
each of relation-specific relevant concepts is then used to represent the structured semantics of the corresponding relation.
The resulting relation-specific subgraphs of BabelNet are used as semantic filters for estimating the adequacy of the extracted rules.
the seven semantic relations tested here.
For the seven semantic relations the semantic filter consistently yields a higher precision at any relative recall value in the high-recall range.
