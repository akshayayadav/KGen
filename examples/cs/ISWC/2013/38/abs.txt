QODI is an automatic ontology-based data integration system (OBDI). QODI is distinguished in that the ontology mapping algorithm dynamically determines a partial mapping specific to the reformulation of each query. The query provides application context not available in the ontologies alone; thereby the system is able to disambiguate mappings for different queries. The mapping algorithm decomposes the query into a set of paths, and compares the set of paths with a similar decomposition of a source ontology. Using test sets from three real world applications, QODI achieves favorable results compared with AgreementMaker, a leading ontology matcher, and an ontology-based implementation of the mapping methods detailed for Clio, the state-of-the-art relational data integration and data exchange system.
