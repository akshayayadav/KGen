For analyzing this type of data, existing topic modeling approaches require manually-defined regularization terms to to bias the topic.
existing topic modeling approaches which are highly tailored toward document collections.
For analyzing this type of data, existing topic modeling approaches require manually-defined regularization terms to exploit.
the topic learning towards structure information.
We propose an approach as a principled approach for automatically learning topics from both textual information.
an approach called Topical Relational Model.
We propose an approach as a principled approach for automatically learning topics from both structure information.
a state-of-the-art approach that requires manually-tuned regularization.
Using a topic model, we can show that We approach is effective in exploiting heterogeneous structure information, outperforming a state-of-the-art approach.
