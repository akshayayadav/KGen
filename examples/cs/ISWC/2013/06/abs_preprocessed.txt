The normative version of RDF Schema gives non-standard ( intensional ) interpretations to some standard notions such as classes thus departing from standard set-based semantics.
The normative version of RDF Schema gives non-standard ( intensional ) interpretations to some standard notions such as properties thus departing from standard set-based semantics.
In this paper we develop a standard set-based ( extensional ) semantics for the RDF Schema vocabulary while preserving the computational complexity of deduction of the intensional version.

This result can positively impact current implementations, as reasoning in RDF Schema can be implemented following common set-based intuitions.
This result can positively impact current implementations, as reasoning in RDF Schema can be compatible with OWL extensions.
