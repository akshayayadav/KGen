The vision behind the Web of Data is to extend the current document-oriented Web with machine-readable facts thus creating a representation of general knowledge.
However, most of the Web of Data is limited to being a large compendium of encyclopedic knowledge.

In this paper, we address the problem of the actuality of the Web of Data by presenting an approach.
an approach that allows extracting RDF triples from unstructured data streams.
a knowledge base that reflects the content of the input streams.
We employ statistical methods in disambiguation to create a knowledge base.
We employ statistical methods in supervised machine learning techniques to create a knowledge base.
We employ statistical methods in unsupervised machine learning techniques to create a knowledge base.
We employ statistical methods in combination with deduplication to create a knowledge base.
We evaluate a sample of the RDF We generate against a large corpus of news streams.
We evaluate a sample of the RDF We show that We achieve a precision of more than 85.
