Type information is very valuable in knowledge bases.
However, most large open knowledge bases contain noisy data.
However, most large open knowledge bases are incomplete with respect to type information.
However, most large open knowledge bases contain incorrect data.
That makes classic type inference by reasoning difficult.
the heuristic link-based type inference mechanism SDType which can handle noisy data.
In this paper, we propose the heuristic link-based type inference mechanism SDType.
the heuristic link-based type inference mechanism SDType which can handle incorrect data.
Instead of leveraging T-box information from the schema, SDType takes the actual use of a schema into account.
Instead of leveraging T-box information from the schema, SDType is also robust to misused schema elements.
