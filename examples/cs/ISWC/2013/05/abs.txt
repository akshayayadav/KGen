For ontology reuse and integration, a number of approaches have been devised that aim at identifying modules, i.e., suitably small sets of “relevant” axioms from ontologies. Here we consider three logically sound notions of modules: MEX modules, only applicable to inexpressive ontologies; modules based on semantic locality, a sound approximation of the first; and modules based on syntactic locality, a sound approximation of the second (and thus the first), widely used since these modules can be extracted from OWL DL ontologies in time polynomial in the size of the ontology.
