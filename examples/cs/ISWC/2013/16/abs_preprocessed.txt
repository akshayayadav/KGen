The Semantic Web makes an extensive use of the OWL DL ontology language, underlied by the SHOIQ description logic, to formalize The Semantic Web resources.
this logic extended with the transitive closure of roles in a feature.
this logic extended with the transitive closure of roles in concept axioms.
In this paper, we propose a decision procedure for this logic.
a feature needed in several application domains.
The most challenging issue we have to deal with when designing such a decision procedure is to represent infinitely non-tree-shaped models.
infinitely non-tree-shaped models which are different from those of SHOIQ ontologies.
To address The most challenging issue we have to deal with when designing such a decision procedure, we introduce a new.
models which may have an infinite non-tree-shaped part.
a new blocking condition for characterizing models.
