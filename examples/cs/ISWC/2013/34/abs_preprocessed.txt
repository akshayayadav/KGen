We present the architecture taking full advantage of storing data in relational databases.
We discuss the theoretical foundations of the OBDA system Ontop: the tree-witness query rewriting, T-mappings based on SQL features.
We discuss the theoretical foundations of the OBDA system Ontop: the tree-witness query rewriting, optimisations based on SQL features.
We discuss the theoretical foundations of the OBDA system Ontop: the tree-witness query rewriting, T-mappings based on database integrity constraints.
We discuss the theoretical foundations of the OBDA system Ontop: the tree-witness query rewriting, optimisations based on database integrity constraints.
We analyse the performance of Ontop in a series of experiments.
standard ontologies, queries and data stored in relational databases.
We demonstrate that, for standard ontologies, queries and data the OBDA system Ontop is fast, efficient.
We demonstrate that, for standard ontologies, queries and data the OBDA system Ontop is fast, produces SQL rewritings of high quality.
