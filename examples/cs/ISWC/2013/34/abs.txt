We present the architecture and technologies underpinning the OBDA system Ontop and taking full advantage of storing data in relational databases. We discuss the theoretical foundations of Ontop: the tree-witness query rewriting, T-mappings and optimisations based on database integrity constraints and SQL features. We analyse the performance of Ontop in a series of experiments and demonstrate that, for standard ontologies, queries and data stored in relational databases, Ontop is fast, efficient and produces SQL rewritings of high quality.
