The discovery of links between resources within knowledge bases is of crucial importance to realize the vision of the Semantic Web.
Addressing this task is especially challenging when dealing with geo-spatial datasets due to this task sheer size of single geo-spatial objects.
Addressing this task is especially challenging when dealing with geo-spatial datasets due to the potential complexity of single geo-spatial objects.
Yet, so far, little attention has been paid to the characteristics of geo-spatial data within the context of link discovery.
In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a reduction-ratio-optimal link discovery approach.
a reduction-ratio-optimal link discovery approach designed especially for geo-spatial data.
In this paper, we address this gap by presenting Orchid.
Orchid relies on a combination of the Hausdorff to compute the distance between geo-spatial objects.
Orchid relies on a combination of orthodromic metrics to compute the distance between geo-spatial objects.
We first present two novel approaches for the efficient computation of Hausdorff distances.
Then, We present the space tiling approach prove that it is optimal with respect to the reduction ratio that Orchid can achieve.
Then, We present the space tiling approach implemented by Orchid.
The evaluation of We approaches is carried out on three real datasets of different size and complexity.
We results suggest that We approaches to the computation of Hausdorff distances require two orders of magnitude less orthodromic distances computations to compare geographical data.
Moreover, our approaches to the computation of Hausdorff distances require two orders of magnitude less time than a naive approach to achieve this goal.
Finally, Our results indicate that Orchid scales to large datasets while outperforming the state of the art significantly.
