ontologies expressed in the EL family of Description Logics after some axioms have been deleted.
We describe a method for updating the classification of ontologies.
ontologies expressed in the EL family of Description Logics after some axioms have been added.
While incremental classification modulo additions is relatively straightforward, handling deletions is more problematic since incremental classification modulo additions requires retracting logical consequences.
logical consequences that are no longer valid.
this problem using various forms of bookkeeping to trace the consequences back to premises.
Known algorithms address this problem.
But such additional data place an extra burden on the reasoner during application of inferences.
But such additional data can consume memory.
a technique which avoids this extra cost while being very efficient for small incremental changes in ontologies.
In this paper, we present a technique.
a technique is freely available as a part of the open-source EL reasoner ELK efficiency is demonstrated on synthetic data.
