Linked Stream Data extends the Linked Data paradigm to dynamic data sources.
Linked Stream Data enables the integration processing of heterogeneous stream data with quasi-static data from the Linked Data Cloud in near-real-time.
Linked Stream Data enables the joint processing of heterogeneous stream data with quasi-static data from the Linked Data Cloud in near-real-time.
Several needs to be in improved in terms of dynamic data sizes, number of concurrent queries.

stream update frequencies.
Several Linked Stream Data processing engines exist but Several scalability still.
So far, none of Several supports parallel processing in the Linked Data Cloud in near-real-time.
Several Linked Stream Data processing engines.
To remedy these limitations, this paper presents an approach for elastically parallelizing the continuous execution of queries over Linked Stream Data.
For this, we have developed novel, highly efficient for continuous query operators.
For this, we have developed scalable parallel algorithms for continuous query operators.
