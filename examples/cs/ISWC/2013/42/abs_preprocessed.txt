the contextual tag cloud system which can execute large volumes of queries about the number of instances.
In this paper we present the infrastructure of the contextual tag cloud system.
instances that use particular ontological terms.
the tags are ontological terms ).
a novel application that helps users explore a large scale RDF dataset.
tags that defines a subset of instances.
the font sizes reflect the number of instances.
instances that use each tag.
The contextual tag cloud system is a novel application.
the tags are classes ).
the tags are properties ).
the context is a set of tags.
The contextual tag cloud system visualizes the patterns of instances.
instances specified by the context a user constructs.
Given a request with a specific context, The contextual tag cloud system needs to quickly find what how many instances in the context use each tag.
Given a request with a specific context, The contextual tag cloud system needs to quickly find what other tags the instances in the context use instances in the context use each tag.
The key question we answer in this paper is how to scale to Linked Data; in particular we use a dataset with 1.4 billion triples.
The key question we answer in this paper is how to scale to Linked Data; in particular we use a dataset over 380,000 tags.
This is complicated by the fact that the calculation should, when directed by the user, consider the entailment of taxonomic andor domainrange axioms in the ontology.
we use three approaches to prune unnecessary counts for faster intersection computations.
we combine a scalable preprocessing approach with a specially-constructed inverted index.
we compare we system with a state-of-the-art triple store, examine how pruning rules interact with inference.
we compare we system with a state-of-the-art triple store, analyze we design choices.
