Semantic models of data sources and services provide support to automate many tasks such as source discovery, data integration, and service composition, but writing these semantic descriptions by hand is a tedious and time-consuming task. Most of the related work focuses on automatic annotation with classes or properties of source attributes or input and output parameters. However, constructing a source model that includes the relationships between the attributes in addition to their semantic types remains a largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we present a graph-based approach to hypothesize a rich semantic description of a new target source from a set of known sources that have been modeled over the same domain ontology. We exploit the domain ontology and the known source models to build a graph that represents the space of plausible source descriptions. Then, we compute the top k candidates and suggest to the user a ranked list of the semantic models for the new source. The approach takes into account user corrections to learn more accurate semantic descriptions of future data sources. Our evaluation shows that our method produces models that are twice as accurate than the models produced using a state of the art system that does not learn from prior models.
