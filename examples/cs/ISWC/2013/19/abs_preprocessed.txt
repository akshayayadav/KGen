The basic idea of the combined approach to query answering in the presence of ontologies is to materialize the consequences of the ontology in the data and then use a limited form of query rewriting to deal with infinite materializations.
query rewriting when DL-Lite is extended with the popular role hierarchies.
While the combined approach to query answering in the presence of ontologies is scalable for ontologies the combined approach to query answering in the presence of ontologies incurs an exponential blowup during query rewriting.
While the combined approach to query answering in the presence of ontologies is efficient for ontologies the combined approach to query answering in the presence of ontologies incurs an exponential blowup during query rewriting.
ontologies that are formulated in the basic version of the description logic DL-Lite.
In this paper, we show how to replace the query rewriting with a filtering technique.
This allows us to handle role hierarchies without an exponential blowup.
This is natural from an implementation perspective.
We also carry out an experimental evaluation.
an experimental evaluation that demonstrates the scalability of this approach.
