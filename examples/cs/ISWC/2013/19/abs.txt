The basic idea of the combined approach to query answering in the presence of ontologies is to materialize the consequences of the ontology in the data and then use a limited form of query rewriting to deal with infinite materializations. While this approach is efficient and scalable for ontologies that are formulated in the basic version of the description logic DL-Lite, it incurs an exponential blowup during query rewriting when DL-Lite is extended with the popular role hierarchies. In this paper, we show how to replace the query rewriting with a filtering technique. This is natural from an implementation perspective and allows us to handle role hierarchies without an exponential blowup. We also carry out an experimental evaluation that demonstrates the scalability of this approach.
