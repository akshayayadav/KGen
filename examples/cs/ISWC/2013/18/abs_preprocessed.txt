the most interesting challenges facing the Semantic Web today.
Automation of service composition is one of the most interesting challenges.
the most interesting challenges facing the Web of services today.
Despite approaches services data flow remains implicit and difficult to be automatically generated.
approaches which are able to infer a partial order of services.
Enhanced with formal representations, the semantic links between input parameters of services can be then exploited to infer services data flow.
Enhanced with formal representations, the semantic links between output parameters of services can be then exploited to infer services data flow.
This work addresses the problem of effectively inferring data flow between services.
services based on This work representations.
To this end, we introduce the non standard Description Logic reasoning join, aiming to provide a “ constructive evidence ” of how non trivial links ) can be inferred in data flow.
To this end, we introduce the non standard Description Logic reasoning join, aiming to provide a “ constructive evidence ” of how many to many parameters ) can be inferred in data flow.
To this end, we introduce the non standard Description Logic reasoning join, aiming to provide a “ constructive evidence ” of why services can be connected.
The preliminary evaluation provides evidence in favor of we approach regarding the completeness of data flow.
