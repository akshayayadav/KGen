We illustrate several novel attacks to the confidentiality of knowledge bases (KB). Then we introduce a new confidentiality model, sensitive enough to detect those attacks, and a method for constructing secure KB views. We identify safe approximations of the background knowledge exploited in the attacks; they can be used to reduce the complexity of constructing secure KB views.
