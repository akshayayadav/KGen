	abstract = {Objective To address the variability in prevalence estimates and inconsistencies in potential risk factors for poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) using a standardized approach and individual participant data (IPD) from international cohorts in the Stroke and Cognition Consortium (STROKOG) consortium.Methods We harmonized data from 13 studies based in 8 countries. Neuropsychological test scores 2 to 6 months after stroke or TIA and appropriate normative data were used to calculate standardized cognitive domain scores. Domain-specific impairment was based on percentile cutoffs from normative groups, and associations between domain scores and risk factors were examined with 1-stage IPD meta-analysis.Results In a combined sample of 3,146 participants admitted to hospital for stroke (97\%) or TIA (3\%), 44\% were impaired in global cognition and 30\% to 35\% were impaired in individual domains 2 to 6 months after the index event. Diabetes mellitus and a history of stroke were strongly associated with poorer cognitive function after covariate adjustments; hypertension, smoking, and atrial fibrillation had weaker domain-specific associations. While there were no significant differences in domain impairment among ethnoracial groups, some interethnic differences were found in the effects of risk factors on cognition.Conclusions This study confirms the high prevalence of PSCI in diverse populations, highlights common risk factors, in particular diabetes mellitus, and points to ethnoracial differences that warrant attention in the development of prevention strategies.AF=atrial fibrillation; CHF=congestive heart failure; DSM-IV=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition; IPD=individual participant data; MI=myocardial infarction; NEMESIS=North East Melbourne Stroke Incidence Study; PROSPER=Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk; PSCI=poststroke cognitive impairment; SAM=Helsinki Stroke Aging Memory Study; STROKDEM=Study of Factors Influencing Post-Stroke Dementia; STROKOG=Stroke and Cognition Consortium},
