	abstract = {Objective To analyze the frequency of inadequately treated risk factors in a large representative cohort of patients with acute ischemic stroke or TIA and to estimate the proportion of events potentially avertable by guideline-compliant preventive therapy compared to the status quo.Methods A total of 1,730 patients from the Poststroke Disease Management STROKE-CARD trial (NCT02156778) were recruited between 2014 and 2017. We focused on 8 risk conditions amenable to drug therapy and 3 lifestyle risk behaviors and assessed pre-event risk factor control in retrospect.Results The proportion of patients with at least 1 inadequately treated risk condition was 79.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 77.6\%{\textendash}81.4\%) and increased to 95.1\% (95\% CI 94.1\%{\textendash}96.1\%) upon consideration of the lifestyle risk behaviors. Risk factor control was worse in patients with recurrent vs first-ever events (p \&lt; 0.001), men vs women (p = 0.003), and patients <=75 vs \&gt;75 years of age (p \&lt; 0.001). The estimated degree of stroke preventability ranged from 0.4\% (95\% CI 0.2\%{\textendash}0.6\%) to 13.7\% (95\% CI 12.2\%{\textendash}15.2\%) for the individual risk factors. Adequate control of the 5 most relevant risk factors combined (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation, smoking, and overweight) would have averted â1 of 2 events or 1 in 4 with a highly conservative computation approach.Conclusions Our study confirms the existence of a considerable gap between risk factor control recommended by guidelines and real-world stroke prevention. Our study intends to increase awareness among physicians about stroke preventability and provides a quantitative basis for the emerging discussion on how to best tackle this challenge.ASCVD=atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; AF=atrial fibrillation; BMI=body mass index; CI=confidence interval; mRS=modified Rankin Scale},
