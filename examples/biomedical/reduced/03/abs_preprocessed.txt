We found that illiteracy was independently associated with higher risk of incident dementia, but not with a more rapid rate of cognitive decline.
We found that illiteracy was independently associated with higher risk of prevalent dementia, but not with a more rapid rate of cognitive decline.

Lower range of cognitive function is closer to diagnostic thresholds for dementia than the range of literate participants.
