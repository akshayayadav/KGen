	abstract = {Objective To test the hypothesis that transcranial magnetic resonance{\textendash}guided focused ultrasound (tcMRgFUS) thalamotomy is effective, durable, and safe for patients with medication-refractory essential tremor (ET), we assessed clinical outcomes at 3-year follow-up of a controlled multicenter prospective trial.Methods Outcomes were based on the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor, including hand combined tremor{\textendash}motor (scale of 0{\textendash}32), functional disability (scale of 0{\textendash}32), and postural tremor (scale of 0{\textendash}4) scores, and total scores from the Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire (scale of 0{\textendash}100). Scores at 36 months were compared with baseline and at 6 months after treatment to assess for efficacy and durability. Adverse events were also reported.Results Measured scores remained improved from baseline to 36 months (all p \&lt; 0.0001). Range of improvement from baseline was 38\%{\textendash}50\% in hand tremor, 43\%{\textendash}56\% in disability, 50\%{\textendash}75\% in postural tremor, and 27\%{\textendash}42\% in quality of life. When compared to scores at 6 months, median scores increased for hand tremor (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0{\textendash}2, p = 0.0098) and disability (95\% CI 1{\textendash}4, p = 0.0001). During the third follow-up year, all previously noted adverse events remained mild or moderate, none worsened, 2 resolved, and no new adverse events occurred.Conclusions Results at 3 years after unilateral tcMRgFUS thalamotomy for ET show continued benefit, and no progressive or delayed complications. Patients may experience mild degradation in some treatment metrics by 3 years, though improvement from baseline remains significant.Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01827904.Classification of evidence This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with severe ET, unilateral tcMRgFUS thalamotomy provides durable benefit after 3 years.AE=adverse event; CI=confidence interval; CRST=Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor; DBS=deep brain stimulation; ET=essential tremor; FDA=Food and Drug Administration; IQR=interquartile range; MR=magnetic resonance; PMA=premarket approval; QOL=quality of life; QUEST=Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire; RCT=randomized controlled trial; tcMRgFUS=transcranial magnetic resonance{\textendash}guided focused ultrasound; Vim=ventral intermediate nucleus},
